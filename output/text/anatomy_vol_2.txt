PREFACE 7

PREFACE

Welcome to Human Anatomy and Physiology, an OpenStax College resource. We created this textbook with several goals
in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement—helping students reach high levels of academic scholarship.
Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a thorough introduction to the content in an accessible
format.

About OpenStax College

OpenStax College is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Our
free textbooks are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure that they are readable, accurate, and organized in
accordance with the scope and sequence requirements of today’s college courses. Unlike traditional textbooks, OpenStax
College resources live online and are owned by the community of educators using them. Through partnerships with
companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students, we are working to improve access to higher education
for all. OpenStax College is an initiative of Rice University and is made possible through the generous support of several
philanthropic foundations.

About OpenStax College’s Resources

OpenStax College resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others:
1) They can be easily customized by instructors for each class, 2) they are “living” resources that grow online through
contributions from science educators, and 3) they are available for free or for a minimal cost.

Customization

OpenStax College learning resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind so that they can be customized for
each course. Our textbooks provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build their own texts. Instructors can select
the sections that are most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their students.
Instructors are encouraged to expand on existing examples in the text by adding unique context via geographically localized
applications and topical connections.

Human Anatomy and Physiology can be easily customized using our online platform (https://openstaxcollege.org/
textbooks/anatomy-and-physiology/adapt). The text is arranged in a modular chapter format. Simply select the content most
relevant to your syllabus and create a textbook that addresses the needs of your class. This customization feature will ensure
that your textbook reflects the goals of your course.

Curation

To broaden access and encourage community curation, Human Anatomy and Physiology is “open source” under a Creative
Commons Attribution (CC BY) license. Members of the scientific community are invited to submit examples, emerging
research, and other feedback to enhance and strengthen the material, keeping it current and relevant for today’s students.
Submit your suggestions to info@openstaxcollege.org, and check in on edition status, alternate versions, errata, and news
on the StaxDash at http://openstaxcollege.org.

Cost

Our textbooks are available for free online, and in low-cost print and tablet editions.

About Human Anatomy and Physiology

Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science
and allied health students. It supports effective teaching and learning, and prepares students for further learning and future
careers. The text focuses on the most important concepts and aims to minimize distracting students with more minor details.

The development choices for this textbook were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply
involved in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical
applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the
discipline meaningful and memorable to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their
future studies.

Coverage and Scope

The units of our Human Anatomy and Physiology textbook adhere to the scope and sequence followed by most two-semester
courses nationwide.

Unit 1: Levels of Organization

Chapters 1-4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, the
levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology. These chapters provide a foundation for the further study

8 PREFACE

of the body. They also focus particularly on how the body’s regions, important chemicals, and cells maintain homeostasis.
Chapter 1 An Introduction to the Human Body

Chapter 2 The Chemical Level of Organization

Chapter 3 The Cellular Level of Organization

Chapter 4 The Tissue Level of Organization

Unit 2: Support and Movement

In Chapters 5-11, students explore the skin, the largest organ of the body, and examine the body’s skeletal and muscular
systems, following a traditional sequence of topics. This unit is the first to walk students through specific systems of the
body, and as it does so, it maintains a focus on homeostasis as well as those diseases and conditions that can disrupt it.
Chapter 5 The Integumentary System

Chapter 6 Bone and Skeletal Tissue

Chapter 7 The Axial Skeleton

Chapter 8 The Appendicular Skeleton

Chapter 9 Joints

Chapter 10 Muscle Tissue

Chapter 11 The Muscular System

Unit 3: Regulation, Integration, and Control

Chapters 12-17 help students answer questions about nervous and endocrine system control and regulation. In a break with
the traditional sequence of topics, the special senses are integrated into the chapter on the somatic nervous system. The
chapter on the neurological examination offers students a unique approach to understanding nervous system function using
five simple but powerful diagnostic tests.

Chapter 12 Introduction to the Nervous System

Chapter 13 The Anatomy of the Nervous System

Chapter 14 The Somatic Nervous System

Chapter 15 The Autonomic Nervous System

Chapter 16 The Neurological Exam

Chapter 17 The Endocrine System

Unit 5: Energy, Maintenance, and Environmental Exchange

In Chapters 22-26, students discover the interaction between body systems and the outside environment for the exchange
of materials, the capture of energy, the release of waste, and the overall maintenance of the internal systems that regulate
the exchange. The explanations and illustrations are particularly focused on how structure relates to function.

Chapter 22 The Respiratory System

Chapter 23 The Digestive System

Chapter 24 Nutrition and Metabolism

Chapter 25 The Urinary System

Chapter 26 Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid—Base Balance

Unit 6: Human Development and the Continuity of Life

The closing chapters examine the male and female reproductive systems, describe the process of human development and
the different stages of pregnancy, and end with a review of the mechanisms of inheritance.

Chapter 27 The Reproductive System

Chapter 28 Development and Genetic Inheritance

Pedagogical Foundation and Features

Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed to promote scientific literacy. Throughout the text, you will find features that
engage the students by taking selected topics a step further.
Homeostatic Imbalances discusses the effects and results of imbalances in the body.
Disorders showcases a disorder that is relevant to the body system at hand. This feature may focus on a specific
disorder, or a set of related disorders.
Diseases showcases a disease that is relevant to the body system at hand.
Aging explores the effect aging has on a body’s system and specific disorders that manifest over time.
Career Connections presents information on the various careers often pursued by allied health students, such as
medical technician, medical examiner, and neurophysiologist. Students are introduced to the educational requirements
for and day-to-day responsibilities in these careers.
Everyday Connections tie anatomical and physiological concepts to emerging issues and discuss these in terms of
everyday life. Topics include “Anabolic Steroids” and “The Effect of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke.”
Interactive Links direct students to online exercises, simulations, animations, and videos to add a fuller context
to core content and help improve understanding of the material. Many features include links to the University of
Michigan’s interactive WebScopes, which allow students to zoom in on micrographs in the collection. These resources
were vetted by reviewers and other subject matter experts to ensure that they are effective and accurate. We strongly

PREFACE 9

urge students to explore these links, whether viewing a video or inputting data into a simulation, to gain the fullest
experience and to learn how to search for information independently.

Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration.
The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and
instructional innovations.

Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most
important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify
the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students’ attention to the
critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is
used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).

By highlighting the most important portions of the illustration, the artwork helps students focus on the most important
points, without overwhelming them.

Micrographs
Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image. If a micrograph was
recorded at 40x, and the image was magnified an additional 2x, we calculated the final magnification of the micrograph to
be 80x.

Please note that, when viewing the textbook electronically, the micrograph magnification provided in the text does not
take into account the size and magnification of the screen on your electronic device. There may be some variation.

12 | THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM AND NERVOUS
TISSUE

As the neural circuitry of the nervous system has become more fully
understood and robotics more sophisticated, it is now possible to integrate technology with the body and restore
abilities following traumatic events. At some point in the future, will this type of technology lead to the ability to augment
our nervous systems? (credit: U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons)

The nervous system is a very complex organ system. In Peter D. Kramer’s book Listening to Prozac, a pharmaceutica
researcher is quoted as saying, “If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to
understand it” (1994). That quote is from the early 1990s; in the two decades since, progress has continued at an amazing
rate within the scientific disciplines of neuroscience. It is an interesting conundrum to consider that the complexity of the
nervous system may be too complex for it (that is, for us) to completely unravel. But our current level of understanding is
probably nowhere close to that limit.

One easy way to begin to understand the structure of the nervous system is to start with the large divisions and work
through to a more in-depth understanding. In other chapters, the finer details of the nervous system will be explained, but
first looking at an overview of the system will allow you to begin to understand how its parts work together. The focus of
this chapter is on nervous (neural) tissue, both its structure and its function. But before you learn about that, you will see a
big picture of the system—actually, a few big pictures.

12.1 | Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous
System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the anatomical and functional divisions of the nervous system
¢ Relate the functional and structural differences between gray matter and white matter structures of the nervous
system to the structure of neurons
¢ List the basic functions of the nervous system

The picture you have in your mind of the nervous system probably includes the brain, the nervous tissue contained within
the cranium, and the spinal cord, the extension of nervous tissue within the vertebral column. That suggests it is made
of two organs—and you may not even think of the spinal cord as an organ—but the nervous system is a very complex
structure. Within the brain, many different and separate regions are responsible for many different and separate functions. It
is as if the nervous system is composed of many organs that all look similar and can only be differentiated using tools such
as the microscope or electrophysiology. In comparison, it is easy to see that the stomach is different than the esophagus or
the liver, so you can imagine the digestive system as a collection of specific organs.

The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems

The nervous system can be divided into two major regions: the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous
system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else (Figure 12.2).
The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral cavity
of the vertebral column. It is a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside these two cavities and
the peripheral nervous system is outside of them, but that is one way to start to think about it. In actuality, there are some
elements of the peripheral nervous system that are within the cranial or vertebral cavities. The peripheral nervous system is
so named because it is on the periphery—meaning beyond the brain and spinal cord. Depending on different aspects of the
nervous system, the dividing line between central and peripheral is not necessarily universal.

Figure 12.2 Central and Peripheral Nervous System The structures of the PNS are referred to as ganglia and
nerves, which can be seen as distinct structures. The equivalent structures in the CNS are not obvious from this overall
perspective and are best examined in prepared tissue under the microscope.

Nervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic types of cells: neurons and glial cells. A glial
cell is one of a variety of cells that provide a framework of tissue that supports the neurons and their activities. The neuron
is the more functionally important of the two, in terms of the communicative function of the nervous system. To describe
the functional divisions of the nervous system, it is important to understand the structure of a neuron. Neurons are cells and
therefore have a soma, or cell body, but they also have extensions of the cell; each extension is generally referred to as a
process. There is one important process that every neuron has called an axon, which is the fiber that connects a neuron with
its target. Another type of process that branches off from the soma is the dendrite. Dendrites are responsible for receiving
most of the input from other neurons. Looking at nervous tissue, there are regions that predominantly contain cell bodies
and regions that are largely composed of just axons. These two regions within nervous system structures are often referred
to as gray matter (the regions with many cell bodies and dendrites) or white matter (the regions with many axons). Figure
12.3 demonstrates the appearance of these regions in the brain and spinal cord. The colors ascribed to these regions are
what would be seen in “fresh,” or unstained, nervous tissue. Gray matter is not necessarily gray. It can be pinkish because of
blood content, or even slightly tan, depending on how long the tissue has been preserved. But white matter is white because
axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Lipids can appear as white (“fatty”) material, much like the fat
on a raw piece of chicken or beef. Actually, gray matter may have that color ascribed to it because next to the white matter,
it is just darker—hence, gray.

The distinction between gray matter and white matter is most often applied to central nervous tissue, which has large
regions that can be seen with the unaided eye. When looking at peripheral structures, often a microscope is used and the
tissue is stained with artificial colors. That is not to say that central nervous tissue cannot be stained and viewed under a
microscope, but unstained tissue is most likely from the CNS—for example, a frontal section of the brain or cross section
of the spinal cord.

shows white matter surrounded by gray matter. Gray matter makes up the outer cortex of the brain. (credit: modification
of work by “Suseno”/Wikimedia Commons)

Regardless of the appearance of stained or unstained tissue, the cell bodies of neurons or axons can be located in
discrete anatomical structures that need to be named. Those names are specific to whether the structure is central or
peripheral. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as a nucleus. In the PNS, a cluster of
neuron cell bodies is referred to as a ganglion. Figure 12.4 indicates how the term nucleus has a few different meanings
within anatomy and physiology. It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is the center of a cell,
where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some function in the CNS. There is also a potentially confusing use of the
word ganglion (plural = ganglia) that has a historical explanation. In the central nervous system, there is a group of nuclei
that are connected together and were once called the basal ganglia before “ganglion” became accepted as a description for
a peripheral structure. Some sources refer to this group of nuclei as the “basal nuclei” to avoid confusion.

Terminology applied to bundles of axons also differs depending on location. A bundle of axons, or fibers, found in the
CNS is called a tract whereas the same thing in the PNS would be called a nerve. There is an important point to make
about these terms, which is that they can both be used to refer to the same bundle of axons. When those axons are in the
PNS, the term is nerve, but if they are CNS, the term is tract. The most obvious example of this is the axons that project
from the retina into the brain. Those axons are called the optic nerve as they leave the eye, but when they are inside the
cranium, they are referred to as the optic tract. There is a specific place where the name changes, which is the optic chiasm,
but they are still the same axons (Figure 12.5). A similar situation outside of science can be described for some roads.
Imagine a road called “Broad Street” in a town called “Anyville.” The road leaves Anyville and goes to the next town over,
called “Hometown.” When the road crosses the line between the two towns and is in Hometown, its name changes to “Main
Street.” That is the idea behind the naming of the retinal axons. In the PNS, they are called the optic nerve, and in the CNS,
they are the optic tract. Table 12.1 helps to clarify which of these terms apply to the central or peripheral nervous systems.

In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul C. Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for
discoveries related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a tool to see the structures of the body (not just the
nervous system) that depends on magnetic fields associated with certain atomic nuclei. The utility of this technique
in the nervous system is that fat tissue and water appear as different shades between black and white. Because white
matter is fatty (from myelin) and gray matter is not, they can be easily distinguished in MRI images. Visit the Nobel
Prize web site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/nobel_2) to play an interactive game that demonstrates the use of this
technology and compares it with other types of imaging technologies. Also, the results from an MRI session are
compared with images obtained from X-ray or computed tomography. How do the imaging techniques shown in this
game indicate the separation of white and gray matter compared with the freshly dissected tissue shown earlier?

Functional Divisions of the Nervous System

The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of its functions, but anatomical divisions and functional divisions are
different. The CNS and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions can be attributed to different
regions of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in the periphery. The problem
with trying to fit functional differences into anatomical divisions is that sometimes the same structure can be part of several
functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are either used for the conscious perception
of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the reflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are
processed through the hypothalamus.

There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous
system are sensation, integration, and response. Secondly, control of the body can be somatic or autonomic—divisions that
are largely defined by the structures that are involved in the response. There is also a region of the peripheral nervous system
that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific set of the functions within the realm of autonomic
control related to gastrointestinal functions.

Basic Functions

The nervous system is involved in receiving information about the environment around us (sensation) and generating
responses to that information (motor responses). The nervous system can be divided into regions that are responsible
for sensation (sensory functions) and for the response (motor functions). But there is a third function that needs to be
included. Sensory input needs to be integrated with other sensations, as well as with memories, emotional state, or learning
(cognition). Some regions of the nervous system are termed integration or association areas. The process of integration
combines sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions such as memories, learning, and emotion to produce a
response.

Sensation. The first major function of the nervous system is sensation—receiving information about the environment to
gain input about what is happening outside the body (or, sometimes, within the body). The sensory functions of the nervous
system register the presence of a change from homeostasis or a particular event in the environment, known as a stimulus.
The senses we think of most are the “big five”: taste, smell, touch, sight, and hearing. The stimuli for taste and smell are
both chemical substances (molecules, compounds, ions, etc.), touch is physical or mechanical stimuli that interact with the
skin, sight is light stimuli, and hearing is the perception of sound, which is a physical stimulus similar to some aspects of
touch. There are actually more senses than just those, but that list represents the major senses. Those five are all senses
that receive stimuli from the outside world, and of which there is conscious perception. Additional sensory stimuli might be
from the internal environment (inside the body), such as the stretch of an organ wall or the concentration of certain ions in
the blood.

Response. The nervous system produces a response on the basis of the stimuli perceived by sensory structures. An
obvious response would be the movement of muscles, such as withdrawing a hand from a hot stove, but there are broader
uses of the term. The nervous system can cause the contraction of all three types of muscle tissue. For example, skeletal
muscle contracts to move the skeleton, cardiac muscle is influenced as heart rate increases during exercise, and smooth
muscle contracts as the digestive system moves food along the digestive tract. Responses also include the neural control of
glands in the body as well, such as the production and secretion of sweat by the eccrine and merocrine sweat glands found
in the skin to lower body temperature.

Responses can be divided into those that are voluntary or conscious (contraction of skeletal muscle) and those that are
involuntary (contraction of smooth muscles, regulation of cardiac muscle, activation of glands). Voluntary responses are
governed by the somatic nervous system and involuntary responses are governed by the autonomic nervous system, which
are discussed in the next section.

Integration. Stimuli that are received by sensory structures are communicated to the nervous system where that
information is processed. This is called integration. Stimuli are compared with, or integrated with, other stimuli, memories
of previous stimuli, or the state of a person at a particular time. This leads to the specific response that will be generated.
Seeing a baseball pitched to a batter will not automatically cause the batter to swing. The trajectory of the ball and its speed
will need to be considered. Maybe the count is three balls and one strike, and the batter wants to let this pitch go by in the
hope of getting a walk to first base. Or maybe the batter’s team is so far ahead, it would be fun to just swing away.

Controlling the Body

The nervous system can be divided into two parts mostly on the basis of a functional difference in responses. The somatic
nervous system (SNS) is responsible for conscious perception and voluntary motor responses. Voluntary motor response
means the contraction of skeletal muscle, but those contractions are not always voluntary in the sense that you have to want
to perform them. Some somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen without a conscious decision to perform
them. If your friend jumps out from behind a corner and yells “Boo!” you will be startled and you might scream or leap
back. You didn’t decide to do that, and you may not have wanted to give your friend a reason to laugh at your expense, but
it is a reflex involving skeletal muscle contractions. Other motor responses become automatic (in other words, unconscious)
as a person learns motor skills (referred to as “habit learning” or “procedural memory”).

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for involuntary control of the body, usually for the sake of
homeostasis (regulation of the internal environment). Sensory input for autonomic functions can be from sensory structures
tuned to external or internal environmental stimuli. The motor output extends to smooth and cardiac muscle as well as

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 475

glandular tissue. The role of the autonomic system is to regulate the organ systems of the body, which usually means to
control homeostasis. Sweat glands, for example, are controlled by the autonomic system. When you are hot, sweating helps
cool your body down. That is a homeostatic mechanism. But when you are nervous, you might start sweating also. That is
not homeostatic, it is the physiological response to an emotional state.

There is another division of the nervous system that describes functional responses. The enteric nervous system
(ENS) is responsible for controlling the smooth muscle and glandular tissue in your digestive system. It is a large part of
the PNS, and is not dependent on the CNS. It is sometimes valid, however, to consider the enteric system to be a part of the
autonomic system because the neural structures that make up the enteric system are a component of the autonomic output
that regulates digestion. There are some differences between the two, but for our purposes here there will be a good bit of
overlap. See Figure 12.6 for examples of where these divisions of the nervous system can be found.

spinal nerves, both motor and sensory fibers, as well as the sensory ganglia (posterior root ganglia and cranial nerve
ganglia). Autonomic structures are found in the nerves also, but include the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia.
The enteric nervous system includes the nervous tissue within the organs of the digestive tract.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/!/troublewstairs) to read about a woman that notices that her daughter is
having trouble walking up the stairs. This leads to the discovery of a hereditary condition that affects the brain and
spinal cord. The electromyography and MRI tests indicated deficiencies in the spinal cord and cerebellum, both of
which are responsible for controlling coordinated movements. To what functional division of the nervous system would
these structures belong?

Everyday CONNECTION

How Much of Your Brain Do You Use?

Have you ever heard the claim that humans only use 10 percent of their brains? Maybe you have seen an advertisement
on a website saying that there is a secret to unlocking the full potential of your mind—as if there were 90 percent of
your brain sitting idle, just waiting for you to use it. If you see an ad like that, don’t click. It isn’t true.

An easy way to see how much of the brain a person uses is to take measurements of brain activity while
performing a task. An example of this kind of measurement is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which
generates a map of the most active areas and can be generated and presented in three dimensions (Figure 12.7). This
procedure is different from the standard MRI technique because it is measuring changes in the tissue in time with an
experimental condition or event.

Figure 12.7 fMRI This fMRI shows activation of the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli. (credit:
“Superborsuk”/Wikimedia Commons)

The underlying assumption is that active nervous tissue will have greater blood flow. By having the subject
perform a visual task, activity all over the brain can be measured. Consider this possible experiment: the subject is told
to look at a screen with a black dot in the middle (a fixation point). A photograph of a face is projected on the screen
away from the center. The subject has to look at the photograph and decipher what it is. The subject has been instructed
to push a button if the photograph is of someone they recognize. The photograph might be of a celebrity, so the subject
would press the button, or it might be of a random person unknown to the subject, so the subject would not press the
button.

In this task, visual sensory areas would be active, integrating areas would be active, motor areas responsible for
moving the eyes would be active, and motor areas for pressing the button with a finger would be active. Those areas
are distributed all around the brain and the {MRI images would show activity in more than just 10 percent of the brain
(some evidence suggests that about 80 percent of the brain is using energy—based on blood flow to the tissue—during
well-defined tasks similar to the one suggested above). This task does not even include all of the functions the brain
performs. There is no language response, the body is mostly lying still in the MRI machine, and it does not consider
the autonomic functions that would be ongoing in the background.

12.2 | Nervous Tissue

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the basic structure of a neuron
¢ Identify the different types of neurons on the basis of polarity
¢ List the glial cells of the CNS and describe their function
¢ List the glial cells of the PNS and describe their function

Nervous tissue is composed of two types of cells, neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the primary type of cell that most
anyone associates with the nervous system. They are responsible for the computation and communication that the nervous
system provides. They are electrically active and release chemical signals to target cells. Glial cells, or glia, are known to
play a supporting role for nervous tissue. Ongoing research pursues an expanded role that glial cells might play in signaling,
but neurons are still considered the basis of this function. Neurons are important, but without glial support they would not
be able to perform their function.

Neurons

Neurons are the cells considered to be the basis of nervous tissue. They are responsible for the electrical signals that
communicate information about sensations, and that produce movements in response to those stimuli, along with inducing
thought processes within the brain. An important part of the function of neurons is in their structure, or shape. The three-
dimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the nervous system possible.

Parts of a Neuron

As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma =
“body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is that they
have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are usually described
as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells. That single axon
can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is
communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other
neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing
locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites,
across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one
direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another.

Figure 12.8 Parts of aNeuron The major parts of the neuron are labeled on a multipolar neuron from the CNS.

Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the axon hillock. This is a tapering
of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components
called axoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also referred to as the initial segment.

Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. Myelin
acts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires. A key difference between myelin
and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called a node of Ranvier
and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is

478 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

wrapped in myelin, is referred to as an axon segment. At the end of the axon is the axon terminal, where there are usually
several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an enlargement called a synaptic end bulb. These
bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/nervetissue3) to learn about how nervous tissue is composed of neurons
and glial cells. Neurons are dynamic cells with the ability to make a vast number of connections, to respond incredibly
quickly to stimuli, and to initiate movements on the basis of those stimuli. They are the focus of intense research
because failures in physiology can lead to devastating illnesses. Why are neurons only found in animals? Based on
what this article says about neuron function, why wouldn't they be helpful for plants or microorganisms?

Types of Neurons

There are many neurons in the nervous system—a number in the trillions. And there are many different types of neurons.
They can be classified by many different criteria. The first way to classify them is by the number of processes attached to
the cell body. Using the standard model of neurons, one of these processes is the axon, and the rest are dendrites. Because
information flows through the neuron from dendrites or cell bodies toward the axon, these names are based on the neuron's
polarity (Figure 12.9).

Unipolar neuron

Multipolar neuron

Figure 12.9 Neuron Classification by Shape Unipolar cells have one process that includes both the axon and
dendrite. Bipolar cells have two processes, the axon and a dendrite. Multipolar cells have more than two processes,
the axon and two or more dendrites.

Unipolar cells have only one process emerging from the cell. True unipolar cells are only found in invertebrate
animals, so the unipolar cells in humans are more appropriately called “pseudo-unipolar” cells. Invertebrate unipolar cells
do not have dendrites. Human unipolar cells have an axon that emerges from the cell body, but it splits so that the
axon can extend along a very long distance. At one end of the axon are dendrites, and at the other end, the axon forms
synaptic connections with a target. Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons and have two unique characteristics. First,
their dendrites are receiving sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus itself. Secondly, the cell bodies
of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory reception is a peripheral function (those dendrites are in the
periphery, perhaps in the skin) so the cell body is in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a ganglion. The axon projects
from the dendrite endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into the central nervous system.

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 479

Bipolar cells have two processes, which extend from each end of the cell body, opposite to each other. One is the axon
and one the dendrite. Bipolar cells are not very common. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium (where smell
stimuli are sensed), and as part of the retina.

Multipolar neurons are all of the neurons that are not unipolar or bipolar. They have one axon and two or more
dendrites (usually many more). With the exception of the unipolar sensory ganglion cells, and the two specific bipolar cells
mentioned above, all other neurons are multipolar. Some cutting edge research suggests that certain neurons in the CNS
do not conform to the standard model of “one, and only one” axon. Some sources describe a fourth type of neuron, called
an anaxonic neuron. The name suggests that it has no axon (an- = “without”), but this is not accurate. Anaxonic neurons
are very small, and if you look through a microscope at the standard resolution used in histology (approximately 400X to
1000X total magnification), you will not be able to distinguish any process specifically as an axon or a dendrite. Any of
those processes can function as an axon depending on the conditions at any given time. Nevertheless, even if they cannot
be easily seen, and one specific process is definitively the axon, these neurons have multiple processes and are therefore
multipolar.

Neurons can also be classified on the basis of where they are found, who found them, what they do, or even what
chemicals they use to communicate with each other. Some neurons referred to in this section on the nervous system are
named on the basis of those sorts of classifications (Figure 12.10). For example, a multipolar neuron that has a very
important role to play in a part of the brain called the cerebellum is known as a Purkinje (commonly pronounced per-KIN-
gee) cell. It is named after the anatomist who discovered it (Jan Evangilista Purkinje, 1787-1869).

Purkinje cell in the cerebellum was named after the scientist who originally described it. (c) Olfactory neurons are

Glial Cells

Glial cells, or neuroglia or simply glia, are the other type of cell found in nervous tissue. They are considered to be
supporting cells, and many functions are directed at helping neurons complete their function for communication. The name
glia comes from the Greek word that means “glue,” and was coined by the German pathologist Rudolph Virchow, who
wrote in 1856: “This connective substance, which is in the brain, the spinal cord, and the special sense nerves, is a kind of
glue (neuroglia) in which the nervous elements are planted.” Today, research into nervous tissue has shown that there are
many deeper roles that these cells play. And research may find much more about them in the future.

There are six types of glial cells. Four of them are found in the CNS and two are found in the PNS. Table 12.2 outlines
some common characteristics and functions.

Glial Cells of the CNS

One cell providing support to neurons of the CNS is the astrocyte, so named because it appears to be star-shaped under the
microscope (astro- = “star”). Astrocytes have many processes extending from their main cell body (not axons or dendrites
like neurons, just cell extensions). Those processes extend to interact with neurons, blood vessels, or the connective tissue
covering the CNS that is called the pia mater (Figure 12.11). Generally, they are supporting cells for the neurons in the
central nervous system. Some ways in which they support neurons in the central nervous system are by maintaining the
concentration of chemicals in the extracellular space, removing excess signaling molecules, reacting to tissue damage,
and contributing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The blood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier that keeps many
substances that circulate in the rest of the body from getting into the central nervous system, restricting what can cross from
circulating blood into the CNS. Nutrient molecules, such as glucose or amino acids, can pass through the BBB, but other
molecules cannot. This actually causes problems with drug delivery to the CNS. Pharmaceutical companies are challenged
to design drugs that can cross the BBB as well as have an effect on the nervous system.

Figure 12.11 Glial Cells of the CNS The CNS has astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells that
support the neurons of the CNS in several ways.

Like a few other parts of the body, the brain has a privileged blood supply. Very little can pass through by diffusion.
Most substances that cross the wall of a blood vessel into the CNS must do so through an active transport process. Because
of this, only specific types of molecules can enter the CNS. Glucose—the primary energy source—is allowed, as are amino
acids. Water and some other small particles, like gases and ions, can enter. But most everything else cannot, including white
blood cells, which are one of the body’s main lines of defense. While this barrier protects the CNS from exposure to toxic
or pathogenic substances, it also keeps out the cells that could protect the brain and spinal cord from disease and damage.
The BBB also makes it harder for pharmaceuticals to be developed that can affect the nervous system. Aside from finding
efficacious substances, the means of delivery is also crucial.

Also found in CNS tissue is the oligodendrocyte, sometimes called just “oligo,” which is the glial cell type that
insulates axons in the CNS. The name means “cell of a few branches” (oligo- = “few”; dendro- = “branches”; -cyte =
“cell”). There are a few processes that extend from the cell body. Each one reaches out and surrounds an axon to insulate it
in myelin. One oligodendrocyte will provide the myelin for multiple axon segments, either for the same axon or for separate
axons. The function of myelin will be discussed below.

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 481

Microglia are, as the name implies, smaller than most of the other glial cells. Ongoing research into these cells,
although not entirely conclusive, suggests that they may originate as white blood cells, called macrophages, that become
part of the CNS during early development. While their origin is not conclusively determined, their function is related to
what macrophages do in the rest of the body. When macrophages encounter diseased or damaged cells in the rest of the
body, they ingest and digest those cells or the pathogens that cause disease. Microglia are the cells in the CNS that can do
this in normal, healthy tissue, and they are therefore also referred to as CNS-resident macrophages.

The ependymal cell is a glial cell that filters blood to make cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that circulates through
the CNS. Because of the privileged blood supply inherent in the BBB, the extracellular space in nervous tissue does not
easily exchange components with the blood. Ependymal cells line each ventricle, one of four central cavities that are
remnants of the hollow center of the neural tube formed during the embryonic development of the brain. The choroid plexus
is a specialized structure in the ventricles where ependymal cells come in contact with blood vessels and filter and absorb
components of the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid. Because of this, ependymal cells can be considered a component of
the BBB, or a place where the BBB breaks down. These glial cells appear similar to epithelial cells, making a single layer of
cells with little intracellular space and tight connections between adjacent cells. They also have cilia on their apical surface
to help move the CSF through the ventricular space. The relationship of these glial cells to the structure of the CNS is seen
in Figure 12.11.

Glial Cells of the PNS

One of the two types of glial cells found in the PNS is the satellite cell. Satellite cells are found in sensory and autonomic
ganglia, where they surround the cell bodies of neurons. This accounts for the name, based on their appearance under the
microscope. They provide support, performing similar functions in the periphery as astrocytes do in the CNS—except, of
course, for establishing the BBB.

The second type of glial cell is the Schwann cell, which insulate axons with myelin in the periphery. Schwann cells
are different than oligodendrocytes, in that a Schwann cell wraps around a portion of only one axon segment and no others.
Oligodendrocytes have processes that reach out to multiple axon segments, whereas the entire Schwann cell surrounds just
one axon segment. The nucleus and cytoplasm of the Schwann cell are on the edge of the myelin sheath. The relationship
of these two types of glial cells to ganglia and nerves in the PNS is seen in Figure 12.12.

Myelin

The insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann cells
in the PNS. Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it insulates is
different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath
that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along
the axon. The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane. Myelin, however, is more than just the
membrane of the glial cell. It also includes important proteins that are integral to that membrane. Some of the proteins help
to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together.

The appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for “pigs in
a blanket” or a similar food. The glial cell is wrapped around the axon several times with little to no cytoplasm between the
glial cell layers. For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell process extends back
toward the cell body. A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon segments in the area. For Schwann
cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the
myelin sheath. During development, the glial cell is loosely or incompletely wrapped around the axon (Figure 12.13a). The


482 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

edges of this loose enclosure extend toward each other, and one end tucks under the other. The inner edge wraps around the
axon, creating several layers, and the other edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed.

The axon contains microtubules and neurofilaments that are bounded by a plasma membrane known as the axolemma.
Outside the plasma membrane of the axon is the myelin sheath, which is composed of the tightly wrapped plasma
membrane of a Schwann cell. What aspects of the cells in this image react with the stain to make them a deep, dark,
black color, such as the multiple layers that are the myelin sheath?

Myelin sheaths can extend for one or two millimeters, depending on the diameter of the axon. Axon diameters can be
as small as 1 to 20 micrometers. Because a micrometer is 1/1000 of a millimeter, this means that the length of a myelin
sheath can be 100-1000 times the diameter of the axon. Figure 12.8, Figure 12.11, and Figure 12.12 show the myelin
sheath surrounding an axon segment, but are not to scale. If the myelin sheath were drawn to scale, the neuron would have
to be immense—possibly covering an entire wall of the room in which you are sitting.

Nervous Tissue

Several diseases can result from the demyelination of axons. The causes of these diseases are not the same; some have
genetic causes, some are caused by pathogens, and others are the result of autoimmune disorders. Though the causes
are varied, the results are largely similar. The myelin insulation of axons is compromised, making electrical signaling
slower.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one such disease. It is an example of an autoimmune disease. The antibodies produced
by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) mark myelin as something that should not be in the body. This causes
inflammation and the destruction of the myelin in the central nervous system. As the insulation around the axons is
destroyed by the disease, scarring becomes obvious. This is where the name of the disease comes from; sclerosis means
hardening of tissue, which is what a scar is. Multiple scars are found in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.
The symptoms of MS include both somatic and autonomic deficits. Control of the musculature is compromised, as is
control of organs such as the bladder.

Guillain-Barré (pronounced gee-YAN bah-RAY) syndrome is an example of a demyelinating disease of the
peripheral nervous system. It is also the result of an autoimmune reaction, but the inflammation is in peripheral nerves.
Sensory symptoms or motor deficits are common, and autonomic failures can lead to changes in the heart rhythm or a
drop in blood pressure, especially when standing, which causes dizziness.

12.3 | The Function of Nervous Tissue

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Distinguish the major functions of the nervous system: sensation, integration, and response
¢ List the sequence of events in a simple sensory receptor—motor response pathway

Having looked at the components of nervous tissue, and the basic anatomy of the nervous system, next comes an
understanding of how nervous tissue is capable of communicating within the nervous system. Before getting to the nuts and
bolts of how this works, an illustration of how the components come together will be helpful. An example is summarized in
Figure 12.14.

Figure 12.14 Testing the Water (1) The sensory neuron has endings in the skin that sense a stimulus such as water
temperature. The strength of the signal that starts here is dependent on the strength of the stimulus. (2) The graded
potential from the sensory endings, if strong enough, will initiate an action potential at the initial segment of the axon
(which is immediately adjacent to the sensory endings in the skin). (3) The axon of the peripheral sensory neuron
enters the spinal cord and contacts another neuron in the gray matter. The contact is a synapse where another graded
potential is caused by the release of a chemical signal from the axon terminals. (4) An action potential is initiated at the
initial segment of this neuron and travels up the sensory pathway to a region of the brain called the thalamus. Another
synapse passes the information along to the next neuron. (5) The sensory pathway ends when the signal reaches the
cerebral cortex. (6) After integration with neurons in other parts of the cerebral cortex, a motor command is sent from
the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex. (7) The upper motor neuron sends an action potential down to the spinal cord.
The target of the upper motor neuron is the dendrites of the lower motor neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord.
(8) The axon of the lower motor neuron emerges from the spinal cord in a nerve and connects to a muscle through a
neuromuscular junction to cause contraction of the target muscle.

Imagine you are about to take a shower in the morning before going to school. You have turned on the faucet to start
the water as you prepare to get in the shower. After a few minutes, you expect the water to be a temperature that will be
comfortable to enter. So you put your hand out into the spray of water. What happens next depends on how your nervous
system interacts with the stimulus of the water temperature and what you do in response to that stimulus.

Found in the skin of your fingers or toes is a type of sensory receptor that is sensitive to temperature, called a
thermoreceptor. When you place your hand under the shower (Figure 12.15), the cell membrane of the thermoreceptors
changes its electrical state (voltage). The amount of change is dependent on the strength of the stimulus (how hot the water
is). This is called a graded potential. If the stimulus is strong, the voltage of the cell membrane will change enough to
generate an electrical signal that will travel down the axon. You have learned about this type of signaling before, with
respect to the interaction of nerves and muscles at the neuromuscular junction. The voltage at which such a signal is
generated is called the threshold, and the resulting electrical signal is called an action potential. In this example, the
action potential travels—a process known as propagation—along the axon from the axon hillock to the axon terminals and
into the synaptic end bulbs. When this signal reaches the end bulbs, it causes the release of a signaling molecule called a
neurotransmitter.

485

486 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

Sensory receptor

Figure 12.15 The Sensory Input Receptors in the skin sense the temperature of the water.

The neurotransmitter diffuses across the short distance of the synapse and binds to a receptor protein of the target
neuron. When the molecular signal binds to the receptor, the cell membrane of the target neuron changes its electrical state
and a new graded potential begins. If that graded potential is strong enough to reach threshold, the second neuron generates
an action potential at its axon hillock. The target of this neuron is another neuron in the thalamus of the brain, the part
of the CNS that acts as a relay for sensory information. At another synapse, neurotransmitter is released and binds to its
receptor. The thalamus then sends the sensory information to the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of gray matter in the
brain, where conscious perception of that water temperature begins.

Within the cerebral cortex, information is processed among many neurons, integrating the stimulus of the water
temperature with other sensory stimuli, with your emotional state (you just aren't ready to wake up; the bed is calling to
you), memories (perhaps of the lab notes you have to study before a quiz). Finally, a plan is developed about what to do,
whether that is to turn the temperature up, turn the whole shower off and go back to bed, or step into the shower. To do any
of these things, the cerebral cortex has to send a command out to your body to move muscles (Figure 12.16).

Figure 12.16 The Motor Response On the basis of the sensory input and the integration in the CNS, a motor
response is formulated and executed.

A region of the cortex is specialized for sending signals down to the spinal cord for movement. The upper motor
neuron is in this region, called the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex, which has an axon that extends all the way
down the spinal cord. At the level of the spinal cord at which this axon makes a synapse, a graded potential occurs in the
cell membrane of a lower motor neuron. This second motor neuron is responsible for causing muscle fibers to contract.
In the manner described in the chapter on muscle tissue, an action potential travels along the motor neuron axon into the
periphery. The axon terminates on muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is released at this specialized
synapse, which causes the muscle action potential to begin, following a large potential known as an end plate potential.
When the lower motor neuron excites the muscle fiber, it contracts. All of this occurs in a fraction of a second, but this story
is the basis of how the nervous system functions.

Neurophysiologist

Understanding how the nervous system works could be a driving force in your career. Studying neurophysiology is a
very rewarding path to follow. It means that there is a lot of work to do, but the rewards are worth the effort.

The career path of a research scientist can be straightforward: college, graduate school, postdoctoral research,
academic research position at a university. A Bachelor’s degree in science will get you started, and for neurophysiology
that might be in biology, psychology, computer science, engineering, or neuroscience. But the real specialization comes
in graduate school. There are many different programs out there to study the nervous system, not just neuroscience
itself. Most graduate programs are doctoral, meaning that a Master’s degree is not part of the work. These are usually
considered five-year programs, with the first two years dedicated to course work and finding a research mentor, and
the last three years dedicated to finding a research topic and pursuing that with a near single-mindedness. The research
will usually result in a few publications in scientific journals, which will make up the bulk of a doctoral dissertation.
After graduating with a Ph.D., researchers will go on to find specialized work called a postdoctoral fellowship within
established labs. In this position, a researcher starts to establish their own research career with the hopes of finding an
academic position at a research university.

Other options are available if you are interested in how the nervous system works. Especially for neurophysiology,
a medical degree might be more suitable so you can learn about the clinical applications of neurophysiology and
possibly work with human subjects. An academic career is not a necessity. Biotechnology firms are eager to find
motivated scientists ready to tackle the tough questions about how the nervous system works so that therapeutic
chemicals can be tested on some of the most challenging disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease,
or spinal cord injury.

Others with a medical degree and a specialization in neuroscience go on to work directly with patients, diagnosing
and treating mental disorders. You can do this as a psychiatrist, a neuropsychologist, a neuroscience nurse, or a
neurodiagnostic technician, among other possible career paths.

12.4 | The Action Potential

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the components of the membrane that establish the resting membrane potential
¢ Describe the changes that occur to the membrane that result in the action potential

The functions of the nervous system—sensation, integration, and response—depend on the functions of the neurons
underlying these pathways. To understand how neurons are able to communicate, it is necessary to describe the role
of an excitable membrane in generating these signals. The basis of this communication is the action potential, which
demonstrates how changes in the membrane can constitute a signal. Looking at the way these signals work in more variable
circumstances involves a look at graded potentials, which will be covered in the next section.

Electrically Active Cell Membranes

Most cells in the body make use of charged particles, ions, to build up a charge across the cell membrane. Previously,
this was shown to be a part of how muscle cells work. For skeletal muscles to contract, based on excitation—contraction
coupling, requires input from a neuron. Both of the cells make use of the cell membrane to regulate ion movement between
the extracellular fluid and cytosol.

As you learned in the chapter on cells, the cell membrane is primarily responsible for regulating what can cross the
membrane and what stays on only one side. The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer, so only substances that can pass
directly through the hydrophobic core can diffuse through unaided. Charged particles, which are hydrophilic by definition,
cannot pass through the cell membrane without assistance (Figure 12.17). Transmembrane proteins, specifically channel
proteins, make this possible. Several channels, as well as specialized energy dependent “ion-pumps,” are necessary to
generate a transmembrane potential and to generate an action potential. Of special interest is the carrier protein referred to as

the sodium/potassium pump that moves sodium ions (Na*) out of a cell and potassium ions (K*) into a cell, thus regulating
ion concentration on both sides of the cell membrane.

bilayer and has many transmembrane proteins, including different types of channel proteins that serve as ion channels.

The sodium/potassium pump requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so it is also referred to as

an ATPase. As was explained in the cell chapter, the concentration of Na” is higher outside the cel

than inside, and the

concentration of K* is higher inside the cell is higher than outside. That means that this pump is moving the ions against the

concentration gradients for sodium and potassium, which is why it requires energy. In fact, the pum

he charge of the ion.

Channels for cations (positive ions) will have negatively charged side chains in the pore. Channels for anions (negative ions)
will have positively charged side chains in the pore. This is called electrochemical exclusion, meaning that the channel

pore is charge-specific.

Ions can also be specified by the diameter of the pore. The distance between the amino acids will be specific for
the diameter of the ion when it dissociates from the water molecules surrounding it. Because of the surrounding water
molecules, larger pores are not ideal for smaller ions because the water molecules will interact, by hydrogen bonds, more
readily than the amino acid side chains. This is called size exclusion. Some ion channels are selective for charge but not

necessarily for size, and thus are called a nonspecific channel. These nonspecific channels allow cations—particularly Na”,

2

K’, and Ca**—1o cross the membrane, but exclude anions.

Ion channels do not always freely allow ions to diffuse across the membrane. They are opened by certain events,
meaning the channels are gated. So another way that channels can be categorized is on the basis of how they are gated.
Although these classes of ion channels are found primarily in cells of nervous or muscular tissue, they also can be found in

cells of epithelial and connective tissues.

A ligand-gated channel opens because a signaling molecule, a ligand, binds to the extracellular region of the channel.
This type of channel is also known as an ionotropic receptor because when the ligand, known as a neurotransmitter in the

nervous system, binds to the protein, ions cross the membrane changing its charge (Figure 12.18).

A mechanically gated channel opens because of a physical distortion of the cell membrane. Many channels associated
with the sense of touch (somatosensation) are mechanically gated. For example, as pressure is applied to the skin, these
channels open and allow ions to enter the cell. Similar to this type of channel would be the channel that opens on the basis
of temperature changes, as in testing the water in the shower (Figure 12.19).

temperature changes, the protein reacts by physically opening the channel.

A voltage-gated channel is a channel that responds to changes in the electrical properties of the membrane in which
it is embedded. Normally, the inner portion of the membrane is at a negative voltage. When that voltage becomes less
negative, the channel begins to allow ions to cross the membrane (Figure 12.20).

A leakage channel is randomly gated, meaning that it opens and closes at random, hence the reference to leaking.
There is no actual event that opens the channel; instead, it has an intrinsic rate of switching between the open and closed
states. Leakage channels contribute to the resting transmembrane voltage of the excitable membrane (Figure 12.21).

particular electrical properties of certain cells are modified by the presence of this type of channel.

The Membrane Potential

The electrical state of the cell membrane can have several variations. These are all variations in the membrane potential.
A potential is a distribution of charge across the cell membrane, measured in millivolts (mV). The standard is to compare
the inside of the cell relative to the outside, so the membrane potential is a value representing the charge on the intracellular
side of the membrane based on the outside being zero, relatively speaking (Figure 12.22).

Figure 12.22 Measuring Charge across a Membrane with a Voltmeter A recording electrode is inserted into the
cell and a reference electrode is outside the cell. By comparing the charge measured by these two electrodes, the
transmembrane voltage is determined. It is conventional to express that value for the cytosol relative to the outside.

The concentration of ions in extracellular and intracellular fluids is largely balanced, with a net neutral charge.
However, a slight difference in charge occurs right at the membrane surface, both internally and externally. It is the
difference in this very limited region that has all the power in neurons (and muscle cells) to generate electrical signals,
including action potentials.

Before these electrical signals can be described, the resting state of the membrane must be explained. When the cell is
at rest, and the ion channels are closed (except for leakage channels which randomly open), ions are distributed across the

membrane in a very predictable way. The concentration of Na” outside the cell is 10 times greater than the concentration

inside. Also, the concentration of K” inside the cell is greater than outside. The cytosol contains a high concentration of
anions, in the form of phosphate ions and negatively charged proteins. Large anions are a component of the inner cell
membrane, including specialized phospholipids and proteins associated with the inner leaflet of the membrane (leaflet is a
term used for one side of the lipid bilayer membrane). The negative charge is localized in the large anions.

With the ions distributed across the membrane at these concentrations, the difference in charge is measured at -70
mV, the value described as the resting membrane potential. The exact value measured for the resting membrane potential
varies between cells, but -70 mV is most commonly used as this value. This voltage would actually be much lower except

for the contributions of some important proteins in the membrane. Leakage channels allow Na” to slowly move into the cell

or K* to slowly move out, and the Na*/K* pump restores them. This may appear to be a waste of energy, but each has a role
in maintaining the membrane potential.

The Action Potential

Resting membrane potential describes the steady state of the cell, which is a dynamic process that is balanced by ion
leakage and ion pumping. Without any outside influence, it will not change. To get an electrical signal started, the membrane
potential has to change.

This starts with a channel opening for Na’ in the membrane. Because the concentration of Na’ is higher outside the cell
than inside the cell by a factor of 10, ions will rush into the cell that are driven largely by the concentration gradient. Because
sodium is a positively charged ion, it will change the relative voltage immediately inside the cell relative to immediately
outside. The resting potential is the state of the membrane at a voltage of -70 mV, so the sodium cation entering the cell will
cause it to become less negative. This is known as depolarization, meaning the membrane potential moves toward zero.

The concentration gradient for Na’ is so strong that it will continue to enter the cell even after the membrane potential
has become zero, so that the voltage immediately around the pore begins to become positive. The electrical gradient also
plays a role, as negative proteins below the membrane attract the sodium ion. The membrane potential will reach +30 mV
by the time sodium has entered the cell.

As the membrane potential reaches +30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. These

channels are specific for the potassium ion. A concentration gradient acts on K*, as well. As K” starts to leave the
cell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is
called repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane
potential.

Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually
overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period of

492 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

hyperpolarization occurs while the K* channels are open. Those K* channels are slightly delayed in closing, accounting for
this short overshoot.

What has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in Figure
12.23. It is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. The change in the membrane voltage from
-70 mV at rest to +30 mV at the end of depolarization is a 100-mV change. That can also be written as a 0.1-V change. To
put that value in perspective, think about a battery. An AA battery that you might find in a television remote has a voltage of
1.5 V, or a 9-V battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V. The change seen in the action
potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. In fact, the membrane potential can be
described as a battery. A charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. A battery
in your remote has stored a charge that is “released” when you push a button.

Figure 12.23 Graph of Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the
action potential begins with depolarization, followed by repolarization, which goes past the resting potential into

What happens across the membrane of an electrically active cell is a dynamic process that is hard to visualize with
static images or through text descriptions. View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/dynamic1) to learn

more about this process. What is the difference between the driving force for Na* and K*? And what is similar about
the movement of these two ions?

The question is, now, what initiates the action potential? The description above conveniently glosses over that point.
But it is vital to understanding what is happening. The membrane potential will stay at the resting voltage until something

changes. The description above just says that a Na” channel opens. Now, to say “a channel opens” does not mean that one
individual transmembrane protein changes. Instead, it means that one kind of channel opens. There are a few different types
of channels that allow Na* to cross the membrane. A ligand-gated Na* channel will open when a neurotransmitter binds
to it and a mechanically gated Na” channel will open when a physical stimulus affects a sensory receptor (like pressure
applied to the skin compresses a touch receptor). Whether it is a neurotransmitter binding to its receptor protein or a sensory
stimulus activating a sensory receptor cell, some stimulus gets the process started. Sodium starts to enter the cell and the
membrane becomes less negative.

A third type of channel that is an important part of depolarization in the action potential is the voltage-gated Na”
channel. The channels that start depolarizing the membrane because of a stimulus help the cell to depolarize from -70 mV

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 493

to -55 mV. Once the membrane reaches that voltage, the voltage-gated Na” channels open. This is what is known as the
threshold. Any depolarization that does not change the membrane potential to -55 mV or higher will not reach threshold
and thus will not result in an action potential. Also, any stimulus that depolarizes the membrane to -55 mV or beyond will
cause a large number of channels to open and an action potential will be initiated.

Because of the threshold, the action potential can be likened to a digital event—it either happens or it does not. If
the threshold is not reached, then no action potential occurs. If depolarization reaches -55 mV, then the action potential

continues and runs all the way to +30 mV, at which K* causes repolarization, including the hyperpolarizing overshoot.
Also, those changes are the same for every action potential, which means that once the threshold is reached, the exact same
thing happens. A stronger stimulus, which might depolarize the membrane well past threshold, will not make a “bigger”
action potential. Action potentials are “all or none.” Either the membrane reaches the threshold and everything occurs as
described above, or the membrane does not reach the threshold and nothing else happens. All action potentials peak at the
same voltage (+30 mV), so one action potential is not bigger than another. Stronger stimuli will initiate multiple action
potentials more quickly, but the individual signals are not bigger. Thus, for example, you will not feel a greater sensation of
pain, or have a stronger muscle contraction, because of the size of the action potential because they are not different sizes.

As we have seen, the depolarization and repolarization of an action potential are dependent on two types of channels
(the voltage-gated Na* channel and the voltage-gated K* channel). The voltage-gated Na® channel actually has two gates.
One is the activation gate, which opens when the membrane potential crosses -55 mV. The other gate is the inactivation
gate, which closes after a specific period of time—on the order of a fraction of a millisecond. When a cell is at rest, the
activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open. However, when the threshold is reached, the activation gate opens,
allowing Na’ to rush into the cell. Timed with the peak of depolarization, the inactivation gate closes. During repolarization,
no more sodium can enter the cell. When the membrane potential passes -55 mV again, the activation gate closes. After
that, the inactivation gate re-opens, making the channel ready to start the whole process over again.

The voltage-gated K* channel has only one gate, which is sensitive to a membrane voltage of -50 mV. However, it does
not open as quickly as the voltage-gated Na* channel does. It might take a fraction of a millisecond for the channel to open
once that voltage has been reached. The timing of this coincides exactly with when the Na” flow peaks, so voltage-gated K*
channels open just as the voltage-gated Na* channels are being inactivated. As the membrane potential repolarizes and the
voltage passes -50 mV again, the channel closes—again, with a little delay. Potassium continues to leave the cell for a short
while and the membrane potential becomes more negative, resulting in the hyperpolarizing overshoot. Then the channel
closes again and the membrane can return to the resting potential because of the ongoing activity of the non-gated channels
and the Na*/K* pump.

All of this takes place within approximately 2 milliseconds (Figure 12.24). While an action potential is in progress,
another one cannot be initiated. That effect is referred to as the refractory period. There are two phases of the refractory
period: the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period. During the absolute phase, another action
potential will not start. This is because of the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated Na® channel. Once that channel is back
to its resting conformation (less than -55 mV), a new action potential could be started, but only by a stronger stimulus than
the one that initiated the current action potential. This is because of the flow of K” out of the cell. Because that ion is rushing

out, any Na’ that tries to enter will not depolarize the cell, but will only keep the cell from hyperpolarizing.

494 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

Propagation of the Action Potential

The action potential is initiated at the beginning of the axon, at what is called the initial segment. There is a high density of
voltage-gated Na” channels so that rapid depolarization can take place here. Going down the length of the axon, the action
potential is propagated because more voltage-gated Na” channels are opened as the depolarization spreads. This spreading
occurs because Na” enters through the channel and moves along the inside of the cell membrane. As the Na” moves, or
‘lows, a short distance along the cell membrane, its positive charge depolarizes a little more of the cell membrane. As that

depolarization spreads, new voltage-gated Na® channels open and more ions rush into the cell, spreading the depolarization
a little farther.

Because voltage-gated Na” channels are inactivated at the peak of the depolarization, they cannot be opened again
or a brief time—the absolute refractory period. Because of this, depolarization spreading back toward previously opened
channels has no effect. The action potential must propagate toward the axon terminals; as a result, the polarity of the neuron
is maintained, as mentioned above.

Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons. When myelination is present, the action potential
propagates differently. Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the axon

segment, but there are no voltage-gated Na” channels until the first node of Ranvier. Because there is not constant opening
of these channels along the axon segment, the depolarization spreads at an optimal speed. The distance between nodes is
the optimal distance to keep the membrane still depolarized above threshold at the next node. As Na® spreads along the
inside of the membrane of the axon segment, the charge starts to dissipate. If the node were any farther down the axon, that
depolarization would have fallen off too much for voltage-gated Na* channels to be activated at the next node of Ranvier.
If the nodes were any closer together, the speed of propagation would be slower.

Propagation along an unmyelinated axon is referred to as continuous conduction; along the length of a myelinated

axon, it is saltatory conduction. Continuous conduction is slow because there are always voltage-gated Na’ channels

opening, and more and more Na’ is rushing into the cell. Saltatory conduction is faster because the action potential basically

jumps from one node to the next (saltare = “to leap”), and the new influx of Na* renews the depolarized membrane. Along
with the myelination of the axon, the diameter of the axon can influence the speed of conduction. Much as water runs faster
in a wide river than in a narrow creek, Na*-based depolarization spreads faster down a wide axon than down a narrow
one. This concept is known as resistance and is generally true for electrical wires or plumbing, just as it is true for axons,
although the specific conditions are different at the scales of electrons or ions versus water in a river.

Homeostatic MBALANCES

Potassium Concentration

Glial cells, especially astrocytes, are responsible for maintaining the chemical environment of the CNS tissue. The
concentrations of ions in the extracellular fluid are the basis for how the membrane potential is established and changes
in electrochemical signaling. If the balance of ions is upset, drastic outcomes are possible.

Normally the concentration of K* is higher inside the neuron than outside. After the repolarizing phase of the
action potential, K* leakage channels and the Na*/K* pump ensure that the ions return to their original locations.
Following a stroke or other ischemic event, extracellular K" levels are elevated. The astrocytes in the area are equipped

to clear excess K* to aid the pump. But when the level is far out of balance, the effects can be irreversible.
Astrocytes can become reactive in cases such as these, which impairs their ability to maintain the local chemical

environment. The glial cells enlarge and their processes swell. They lose their K* buffering ability and the function of
the pump is affected, or even reversed. If a Na* gradient breaks down, this has a more important effect than interrupting

the action potential. Glucose transport into cells is coupled with Na* co-transport. When that is lost, the cell cannot
get the energy it needs. In the central nervous system, carbohydrate metabolism is the only means of producing ATP.
Elsewhere in the body, cells rely on carbohydrates, lipids, or amino acids to power mitochondrial ATP production.
But the CNS does not store lipids in adipocytes (fat cells) as an energy reserve. The lipids in the CNS are in the
cell membranes of neurons and glial cells, notably as an integral component of myelin. Proteins in the CNS are
crucial to neuronal function, in roles such as channels for electrical signaling or as part of the cytoskeleton. Those
macromolecules are not used to power mitochondrial ATP production in neurons.

Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/neurolab) to see a virtual neurophysiology lab, and to observe
electrophysiological processes in the nervous system, where scientists directly measure the electrical signals produced
by neurons. Often, the action potentials occur so rapidly that watching a screen to see them occur is not helpful. A
speaker is powered by the signals recorded from a neuron and it “pops” each time the neuron fires an action potential.
These action potentials are firing so fast that it sounds like static on the radio. Electrophysiologists can recognize the
patterns within that static to understand what is happening. Why is the leech model used for measuring the electrical
activity of neurons instead of using humans?

12.5 | Communication Between Neurons

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain the differences between the types of graded potentials
* Categorize the major neurotransmitters by chemical type and effect

The electrical changes taking place within a neuron, as described in the previous section, are similar to a light switch being
turned on. A stimulus starts the depolarization, but the action potential runs on its own once a threshold has been reached.
The question is now, “What flips the light switch on?” Temporary changes to the cell membrane voltage can result from
neurons receiving information from the environment, or from the action of one neuron on another. These special types of
potentials influence a neuron and determine whether an action potential will occur or not. Many of these transient signals
originate at the synapse.

Graded Potentials

Local changes in the membrane potential are called graded potentials and are usually associated with the dendrites of
a neuron. The amount of change in the membrane potential is determined by the size of the stimulus that causes it.
In the example of testing the temperature of the shower, slightly warm water would only initiate a small change in a
thermoreceptor, whereas hot water would cause a large amount of change in the membrane potential.

Graded potentials can be of two sorts, either they are depolarizing or hyperpolarizing (Figure 12.25). For a membrane
at the resting potential, a graded potential represents a change in that voltage either above -70 mV or below -70 mV.
Depolarizing graded potentials are often the result of Na‘ or Ca** entering the cell. Both of these ions have higher
concentrations outside the cell than inside; because they have a positive charge, they will move into the cell causing it to
become less negative relative to the outside. Hyperpolarizing graded potentials can be caused by K™ leaving the cell or Cl

entering the cell. If a positive charge moves out of a cell, the cell becomes more negative; if a negative charge enters the
cell, the same thing happens.

Figure 12.25 Graded Potentials Graded potentials are temporary changes in the membrane voltage, the
characteristics of which depend on the size of the stimulus. Some types of stimuli cause depolarization of the
membrane, whereas others cause hyperpolarization. It depends on the specific ion channels that are activated in the
cell membrane.

Types of Graded Potentials

For the unipolar cells of sensory neurons—both those with free nerve endings and those within encapsulations—graded
potentials develop in the dendrites that influence the generation of an action potential in the axon of the same cell. This
is called a generator potential. For other sensory receptor cells, such as taste cells or photoreceptors of the retina, graded
potentials in their membranes result in the release of neurotransmitters at synapses with sensory neurons. This is called a
receptor potential.

A postsynaptic potential (PSP) is the graded potential in the dendrites of a neuron that is receiving synapses from
other cells. Postsynaptic potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. Depolarization in a postsynaptic potential is
called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) because it causes the membrane potential to move toward threshold.
Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) because it causes the
membrane potential to move away from threshold.

Summation

All types of graded potentials will result in small changes of either depolarization or hyperpolarization in the voltage of
a membrane. These changes can lead to the neuron reaching threshold if the changes add together, or summate. The
combined effects of different types of graded potentials are illustrated in Figure 12.26. If the total change in voltage in the
membrane is a positive 15 mV, meaning that the membrane depolarizes from -70 mV to -55 mV, then the graded potentials
will result in the membrane reaching threshold.

For receptor potentials, threshold is not a factor because the change in membrane potential for receptor cells directly
causes neurotransmitter release. However, generator potentials can initiate action potentials in the sensory neuron axon, and
postsynaptic potentials can initiate an action potential in the axon of other neurons. Graded potentials summate at a specific
location at the beginning of the axon to initiate the action potential, namely the initial segment. For sensory neurons, which
do not have a cell body between the dendrites and the axon, the initial segment is directly adjacent to the dendritic endings.
For all other neurons, the axon hillock is essentially the initial segment of the axon, and it is where summation takes place.

These locations have a high density of voltage-gated Na* channels that initiate the depolarizing phase of the action potential.

Summation can be spatial or temporal, meaning it can be the result of multiple graded potentials at different locations
on the neuron, or all at the same place but separated in time. Spatial summation is related to associating the activity of
multiple inputs to a neuron with each other. Temporal summation is the relationship of multiple action potentials from a
single cell resulting in a significant change in the membrane potential. Spatial and temporal summation can act together, as
well.

change in the membrane potential. At point A, several different excitatory postsynaptic potentials add up to a large

depolarization. At point B, a mix of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials result in a different end result for
the membrane potential.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/summation) to learn about summation. The process of converting
electrical signals to chemical signals and back requires subtle changes that can result in transient increases or decreases
in membrane voltage. To cause a lasting change in the target cell, multiple signals are usually added together, or
summated. Does spatial summation have to happen all at once, or can the separate signals arrive on the postsynaptic

neuron at slightly different times? Explain your answer.

Synapses

There are two types of connections between electrically active cells, chemical synapses and electrical synapses. In a
chemical synapse, a chemical signal—namely, a neurotransmitter—is released from one cell and it affects the other cell.
In an electrical synapse, there is a direct connection between the two cells so that ions can pass directly from one cell to
the next. If one cell is depolarized in an electrical synapse, the joined cell also depolarizes because the ions pass between
the cells. Chemical synapses involve the transmission of chemical information from one cell to the next. This section will
concentrate on the chemical type of synapse.

An example of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) described in the chapter on muscle tissue. In

the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ. All synapses have common
characteristics, which can be summarized in this list:

presynaptic element

neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles)

synaptic cleft

receptor proteins

postsynaptic element

neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake

For the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neuron's axon terminals, the

neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, the synaptic cleft is the space between the cells where the neurotransmitter diffuses, the
receptor protein is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the postsynaptic element is the sarcolemma of the muscle cell, and

497

498 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

the neurotransmitter is eliminated by acetylcholinesterase. Other synapses are similar to this, and the specifics are different,
but they all contain the same characteristics.

Neurotransmitter Release

When an action potential reaches the axon terminals, voltage-gated Ca** channels in the membrane of the synaptic end
bulb open. The concentration of Ca?* increases inside the end bulb, and the Ca?* ion associates with proteins in the outer
surface of neurotransmitter vesicles. The Ca" facilitates the merging of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane so that
the neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis into the small gap between the cells, known as the synaptic cleft.

Once in the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter diffuses the short distance to the postsynaptic membrane and can
interact with neurotransmitter receptors. Receptors are specific for the neurotransmitter, and the two fit together like a key
and lock. One neurotransmitter binds to its receptor and will not bind to receptors for other neurotransmitters, making the
binding a specific chemical event (Figure 12.27).

Figure 12.27 The Synapse The synapse is a connection between a neuron and its target cell (which is not
necessarily a neuron). The presynaptic element is the synaptic end bulb of the axon where Ca** enters the bulb to
cause vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind to
its receptor. The neurotransmitter is cleared from the synapse either by enzymatic degradation, neuronal reuptake, or
glial reuptake.

Neurotransmitter Systems

There are several systems of neurotransmitters that are found at various synapses in the nervous system. These groups refer
to the chemicals that are the neurotransmitters, and within the groups are specific systems.

The first group, which is a neurotransmitter system of its own, is the cholinergic system. It is the system based on
acetylcholine. This includes the NMJ as an example of a cholinergic synapse, but cholinergic synapses are found in other
parts of the nervous system. They are in the autonomic nervous system, as well as distributed throughout the brain.

The cholinergic system has two types of receptors, the nicotinic receptor is found in the NMJ as well as other
synapses. There is also an acetylcholine receptor known as the muscarinic receptor. Both of these receptors are named for
drugs that interact with the receptor in addition to acetylcholine. Nicotine will bind to the nicotinic receptor and activate it
similar to acetylcholine. Muscarine, a product of certain mushrooms, will bind to the muscarinic receptor. However, nicotine
will not bind to the muscarinic receptor and muscarine will not bind to the nicotinic receptor.

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 499

Another group of neurotransmitters are amino acids. This includes glutamate (Glu), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric
acid, a derivative of glutamate), and glycine (Gly). These amino acids have an amino group and a carboxyl group in
their chemical structures. Glutamate is one of the 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins. Each amino acid
neurotransmitter would be part of its own system, namely the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic systems. They
each have their own receptors and do not interact with each other. Amino acid neurotransmitters are eliminated from the
synapse by reuptake. A pump in the cell membrane of the presynaptic element, or sometimes a neighboring glial cell, will
clear the amino acid from the synaptic cleft so that it can be recycled, repackaged in vesicles, and released again.

Another class of neurotransmitter is the biogenic amine, a group of neurotransmitters that are enzymatically made
from amino acids. They have amino groups in them, but no longer have carboxyl groups and are therefore no longer
classified as amino acids. Serotonin is made from tryptophan. It is the basis of the serotonergic system, which has its own
specific receptors. Serotonin is transported back into the presynaptic cell for repackaging.

Other biogenic amines are made from tyrosine, and include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Dopamine
is part of its own system, the dopaminergic system, which has dopamine receptors. Dopamine is removed from the
synapse by transport proteins in the presynaptic cell membrane. Norepinephrine and epinephrine belong to the adrenergic
neurotransmitter system. The two molecules are very similar and bind to the same receptors, which are referred to as
pha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are also transported back into the presynaptic cell. The chemical
epinephrine (epi- = “on”; “-nephrine” = kidney) is also known as adrenaline (renal = “kidney”), and norepinephrine is
sometimes referred to as noradrenaline. The adrenal gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into the
blood stream as hormones.

A neuropeptide is a neurotransmitter molecule made up of chains of amino acids connected by peptide bonds. This
is what a protein is, but the term protein implies a certain length to the molecule. Some neuropeptides are quite short, such
as met-enkephalin, which is five amino acids long. Others are long, such as beta-endorphin, which is 31 amino acids long.
Neuropeptides are often released at synapses in combination with another neurotransmitter, and they often act as hormones
in other systems of the body, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or substance P.

The effect of a neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic element is entirely dependent on the receptor protein. First, if
there is no receptor protein in the membrane of the postsynaptic element, then the neurotransmitter has no effect. The
depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effect is also dependent on the receptor. When acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor,

fa

the postsynaptic cell is depolarized. This is because the receptor is a cation channel and positively charged Na’ will rush
into the cell. However, when acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptor, of which there are several variants, it might
cause depolarization or hyperpolarization of the target cell.

The amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate, glycine, and GABA, are almost exclusively associated with just one
effect. Glutamate is considered an excitatory amino acid, but only because Glu receptors in the adult cause depolarization
of the postsynaptic cell. Glycine and GABA are considered inhibitory amino acids, again because their receptors cause
hyperpolarization.

The biogenic amines have mixed effects. For example, the dopamine receptors that are classified as D1 receptors
are excitatory whereas D2-type receptors are inhibitory. Biogenic amine receptors and neuropeptide receptors can have
even more complex effects because some may not directly affect the membrane potential, but rather have an effect on
gene transcription or other metabolic processes in the neuron. The characteristics of the various neurotransmitter systems
presented in this section are organized in Table 12.3.

The important thing to remember about neurotransmitters, and signaling chemicals in general, is that the effect is
entirely dependent on the receptor. Neurotransmitters bind to one of two classes of receptors at the cell surface, ionotropic
or metabotropic (Figure 12.28). lonotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, such as the nicotinic receptor for
acetylcholine or the glycine receptor. A metabotropic receptor involves a complex of proteins that result in metabolic
changes within the cell. The receptor complex includes the transmembrane receptor protein, a G protein, and an effector
protein. The neurotransmitter, referred to as the first messenger, binds to the receptor protein on the extracellular surface of
the cell, and the intracellular side of the protein initiates activity of the G protein. The G protein is a guanosine triphosphate
(GTP) hydrolase that physically moves from the receptor protein to the effector protein to activate the latter. An effector
protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the generation of a new molecule, which acts as the intracellular mediator of the signal
that binds to the receptor. This intracellular mediator is called the second messenger.

Different receptors use different second messengers. Two common examples of second messengers are cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). The enzyme adenylate cyclase (an example of an
effector protein) makes cAMP, and phospholipase C is the enzyme that makes IP3. Second messengers, after they are
produced by the effector protein, cause metabolic changes within the cell. These changes are most likely the activation
of other enzymes in the cell. In neurons, they often modify ion channels, either opening or closing them. These enzymes
can also cause changes in the cell, such as the activation of genes in the nucleus, and therefore the increased synthesis of
proteins. In neurons, these kinds of changes are often the basis of stronger connections between cells at the synapse and
may be the basis of learning and memory.

Nervous System

The underlying cause of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, appears to be related
to proteins—specifically, to proteins behaving badly. One of the strongest theories of what causes Alzheimer’s disease
is based on the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, dense conglomerations of a protein that is not functioning
correctly. Parkinson’s disease is linked to an increase in a protein known as alpha-synuclein that is toxic to the cells of
the substantia nigra nucleus in the midbrain.

For proteins to function correctly, they are dependent on their three-dimensional shape. The linear sequence of
amino acids folds into a three-dimensional shape that is based on the interactions between and among those amino
acids. When the folding is disturbed, and proteins take on a different shape, they stop functioning correctly. But the
disease is not necessarily the result of functional loss of these proteins; rather, these altered proteins start to accumulate
and may become toxic. For example, in Alzheimer’s, the hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of these amyloid
plaques in the cerebral cortex. The term coined to describe this sort of disease is “proteopathy” and it includes other
diseases. Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, the human variant of the prion disease known as mad cow disease in the bovine,
also involves the accumulation of amyloid plaques, similar to Alzheimer’s. Diseases of other organ systems can fall
into this group as well, such as cystic fibrosis or type 2 diabetes. Recognizing the relationship between these diseases
has suggested new therapeutic possibilities. Interfering with the accumulation of the proteins, and possibly as early as
their original production within the cell, may unlock new ways to alleviate these devastating diseases.

CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE 507
CHAPTER REVIEW

12.1 Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System

The nervous system can be separated into divisions on the basis of anatomy and physiology. The anatomical divisions are
the central and peripheral nervous systems. The CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The PNS is everything else. Functionally,
the nervous system can be divided into those regions that are responsible for sensation, those that are responsible for
integration, and those that are responsible for generating responses. All of these functional areas are found in both the central
and peripheral anatomy.

Considering the anatomical regions of the nervous system, there are specific names for the structures within each
division. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies is referred to as a nucleus in the CNS and as a ganglion in the PNS. A
bundle of axons is referred to as a tract in the CNS and as a nerve in the PNS. Whereas nuclei and ganglia are specifically
in the central or peripheral divisions, axons can cross the boundary between the two. A single axon can be part of a nerve
and a tract. The name for that specific structure depends on its location.

Nervous tissue can also be described as gray matter and white matter on the basis of its appearance in unstained tissue.
These descriptions are more often used in the CNS. Gray matter is where nuclei are found and white matter is where tracts
are found. In the PNS, ganglia are basically gray matter and nerves are white matter.

The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of how it controls the body. The somatic nervous system (SNS)
is responsible for functions that result in moving skeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative functions that result in
the movement of skeletal muscle would be considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for
functions that affect cardiac or smooth muscle tissue, or that cause glands to produce their secretions. Autonomic functions
are distributed between central and peripheral regions of the nervous system. The sensations that lead to autonomic
functions can be the same sensations that are part of initiating somatic responses. Somatic and autonomic integrative
functions may overlap as well.

A special division of the nervous system is the enteric nervous system, which is responsible for controlling the
digestive organs. Parts of the autonomic nervous system overlap with the enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous
system is exclusively found in the periphery because it is the nervous tissue in the organs of the digestive system.

12.2 Nervous Tissue

Nervous tissue contains two major cell types, neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the cells responsible for communication
through electrical signals. Glial cells are supporting cells, maintaining the environment around the neurons.

Neurons are polarized cells, based on the flow of electrical signals along their membrane. Signals are received at the
dendrites, are passed along the cell body, and propagate along the axon towards the target, which may be another neuron,
muscle tissue, or a gland. Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells
provide this insulation.

Several types of glial cells are found in the nervous system, and they can be categorized by the anatomical division
in which they are found. In the CNS, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells are found. Astrocytes
are important for maintaining the chemical environment around the neuron and are crucial for regulating the blood-brain
barrier. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia in the CNS. Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in immune
surveillance. Ependymal cells are responsible for filtering the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid, which is a circulatory
fluid that performs some of the functions of blood in the brain and spinal cord because of the BBB. In the PNS, satellite
cells are supporting cells for the neurons, and Schwann cells insulate peripheral axons.

12.3 The Function of Nervous Tissue

Sensation starts with the activation of a sensory ending, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing the temperature of
the water. The sensory endings in the skin initiate an electrical signal that travels along the sensory axon within a nerve
into the spinal cord, where it synapses with a neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The temperature information
represented in that electrical signal is passed to the next neuron by a chemical signal that diffuses across the small gap of
the synapse and initiates a new electrical signal in the target cell. That signal travels through the sensory pathway to the
brain, passing through the thalamus, where conscious perception of the water temperature is made possible by the cerebral
cortex. Following integration of that information with other cognitive processes and sensory information, the brain sends a
command back down to the spinal cord to initiate a motor response by controlling a skeletal muscle. The motor pathway is
composed of two cells, the upper motor neuron and the lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron has its cell body in the
cerebral cortex and synapses on a cell in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The lower motor neuron is that cell in the gray
matter of the spinal cord and its axon extends into the periphery where it synapses with a skeletal muscle in a neuromuscular
junction.

12.4 The Action Potential

The nervous system is characterized by electrical signals that are sent from one area to another. Whether those areas are
close or very far apart, the signal must travel along an axon. The basis of the electrical signal is the controlled distribution of

508 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE

ions across the membrane. Transmembrane ion channels regulate when ions can move in or out of the cell, so that a precise
signal is generated. This signal is the action potential which has a very characteristic shape based on voltage changes across
the membrane in a given time period.

The membrane is normally at rest with established Na” and K* concentrations on either side. A stimulus will start the
depolarization of the membrane, and voltage-gated channels will result in further depolarization followed by repolarization
of the membrane. A slight overshoot of hyperpolarization marks the end of the action potential. While an action potential

is in progress, another cannot be generated under the same conditions. While the voltage-gated Na* channel is inactivated,
absolutely no action potentials can be generated. Once that channel has returned to its resting state, a new action potential

is possible, but it must be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to overcome the K* leaving the cell.

The action potential travels down the axon as voltage-gated ion channels are opened by the spreading depolarization.
In unmyelinated axons, this happens in a continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated channels throughout the
membrane. In myelinated axons, propagation is described as saltatory because voltage-gated channels are only found at the
nodes of Ranvier and the electrical events seem to “jump” from one node to the next. Saltatory conduction is faster than
continuous conduction, meaning that myelinated axons propagate their signals faster. The diameter of the axon also makes
a difference as ions diffusing within the cell have less resistance in a wider space.

12.5 Communication Between Neurons

The basis of the electrical signal within a neuron is the action potential that propagates down the axon. For a neuron to
generate an action potential, it needs to receive input from another source, either another neuron or a sensory stimulus. That
input will result in opening ion channels in the neuron, resulting in a graded potential based on the strength of the stimulus.
Graded potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing and can summate to affect the probability of the neuron reaching
threshold.

Graded potentials can be the result of sensory stimuli. If the sensory stimulus is received by the dendrites of a
unipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron ending in the skin, the graded potential is called a generator potential
because it can directly generate the action potential in the initial segment of the axon. If the sensory stimulus is received
by a specialized sensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a receptor potential. Graded potentials produced by
interactions between neurons at synapses are called postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A depolarizing graded potential at a
synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a hyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an inhibitory PSP.

Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which can either be chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical synapses
are far more common. At a chemical synapse, neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic element and diffuses across
the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter binds to a receptor protein and causes a change in the postsynaptic membrane (the
PSP). The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or removed from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is limited in time.

The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based on the neurotransmitter system produced by that neuron. The
cholinergic system is found at the neuromuscular junction and in certain places within the nervous system. Amino acids,
such as glutamate, glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are used as neurotransmitters. Other neurotransmitters
are the result of amino acids being enzymatically changed, as in the biogenic amines, or being covalently bonded together,
as in the neuropeptides.

Figure 13.1 Human Nervous System. The ability to balance like an acrobat combines functions throughout the
nervous system. The central and peripheral divisions coordinate control of the body using the senses of balance, body
position, and touch on the soles of the feet. (credit: Rhett Sutphin)

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Relate the developmental processes of the embryonic nervous system to the adult structures

* Name the major regions of the adult nervous system

* Locate regions of the cerebral cortex on the basis of anatomical landmarks common to all human brains
* Describe the regions of the spinal cord in cross-section

* List the cranial nerves in order of anatomical location and provide the central and peripheral connections
¢ List the spinal nerves by vertebral region and by which nerve plexus each supplies

The nervous system is responsible for controlling much of the body, both through somatic (voluntary) and autonomic
(involuntary) functions. The structures of the nervous system must be described in detail to understand how many of these
functions are possible. There is a physiological concept known as localization of function that states that certain structures
are specifically responsible for prescribed functions. It is an underlying concept in all of anatomy and physiology, but the
nervous system illustrates the concept very well.

Fresh, unstained nervous tissue can be described as gray or white matter, and within those two types of tissue it can be
very hard to see any detail. However, as specific regions and structures have been described, they were related to specific

514 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

functions. Understanding these structures and the functions they perform requires a detailed description of the anatomy of
the nervous system, delving deep into what the central and peripheral structures are.

The place to start this study of the nervous system is the beginning of the individual human life, within the womb. The
embryonic development of the nervous system allows for a simple framework on which progressively more complicated
structures can be built. With this framework in place, a thorough investigation of the nervous system is possible.

13.1 | The Embryologic Perspective

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the growth and differentiation of the neural tube

¢ Relate the different stages of development to the adult structures of the central nervous system
¢ Explain the expansion of the ventricular system of the adult brain from the central canal of the neural tube
¢ Describe the connections of the diencephalon and cerebellum on the basis of patterns of embryonic development

The brain is a complex organ composed of gray parts and white matter, which can be hard to distinguish. Starting from an
embryologic perspective allows you to understand more easily how the parts relate to each other. The embryonic nervous
system begins as a very simple structure—essentially just a straight line, which then gets increasingly complex. Looking at
the development of the nervous system with a couple of early snapshots makes it easier to understand the whole complex
system.

Many structures that appear to be adjacent in the adult brain are not connected, and the connections that exist may
seem arbitrary. But there is an underlying order to the system that comes from how different parts develop. By following
the developmental pattern, it is possible to learn what the major regions of the nervous system are.

The Neural Tube

To begin, a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, starts dividing to
generate the cells that make up an entire organism. Sixteen days after fertilization, the developing embryo’s cells belong to
one of three germ layers that give rise to the different tissues in the body. The endoderm, or inner tissue, is responsible for
generating the lining tissues of various spaces within the body, such as the mucosae of the digestive and respiratory systems.
The mesoderm, or middle tissue, gives rise to most of the muscle and connective tissues. Finally the ectoderm, or outer
tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the nervous system. It is probably not difficult to see that the
outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body. But how is it responsible for the nervous system?

As the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm, which
is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system. Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the
neuroepithelium, forming a neural plate. The cells then begin to change shape, causing the tissue to buckle and fold inward
(Figure 13.2). A neural groove forms, visible as a line along the dorsal surface of the embryo. The ridge-like edge on either
side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold. As the neural folds come together and converge, the underlying
structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called the neural tube. Cells from the neural folds then separate from
the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells referred to as the neural crest, which runs lateral to the neural tube. The neural crest
migrates away from the nascent, or embryonic, central nervous system (CNS) that will form along the neural groove and
develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including the enteric nervous tissue. Many tissues that
are not part of the nervous system also arise from the neural crest, such as craniofacial cartilage and bone, and melanocytes.

Figure 13.2 Early Embryonic Development of Nervous System The neuroectoderm begins to fold inward to form
the neural groove. As the two sides of the neural groove converge, they form the neural tube, which lies beneath the
ectoderm. The anterior end of the neural tube will develop into the brain, and the posterior portion will become the
spinal cord. The neural crest develops into peripheral structures.

At this point, the early nervous system is a simple, hollow tube. It runs from the anterior end of the embryo to the
posterior end. Beginning at 25 days, the anterior end develops into the brain, and the posterior portion becomes the spinal
cord. This is the most basic arrangement of tissue in the nervous system, and it gives rise to the more complex structures by
the fourth week of development.

Primary Vesicles

As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the
production of sac-like vesicles. Similar to a child’s balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins to take on a new
shape. Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are called primary vesicles. These vesicles are given names that are
based on Greek words, the main root word being enkephalon, which means “brain” (en- = “inside”; kephalon = “head”).
The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the developing nervous system.

The prosencephalon (pros- = “in front”) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean
forebrain. The mesencephalon (mes- = “middle”) is the next vesicle, which can be called the midbrain. The third vesicle
at this stage is the rhombencephalon. The first part of this word is also the root of the word rhombus, which is a geometrical
figure with four sides of equal length (a square is a rhombus with 90° angles). Whereas prosencephalon and mesencephalon
translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for “four-sided-figure-brain.” However, the
third vesicle can be called the hindbrain. One way of thinking about how the brain is arranged is to use these three

regions—forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain—which are based on the primary vesicle stage of development (Figure 13.3a).

Secondary Vesicles

The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles
become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the
diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two that
will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup
develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina. This is a rare example
of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully
formed nervous system.

The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain
at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a
large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is useful in considering
its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking.

The rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to the
adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little
brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself. The most significant
connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of
the same vesicle. The myelencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the medulla oblongata. The structures
that come from the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, except for the cerebellum, are collectively considered the brain
stem, which specifically includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla.

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/braindevel) to examine the development of the brain, starting
with the neural tube. As the anterior end of the neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles that
establish the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Those structures continue to develop throughout the rest of embryonic
development and into adolescence. They are the basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain. How would
you describe the difference in the relative sizes of the three regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th
embryonic day) brain and the adult brain?

Spinal Cord Development

While the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal cord is developing from the posterior neural tube.
However, its structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube. It is a long, straight cord with a small,
hollow space down the center. The neural tube is defined in terms of its anterior versus posterior portions, but it also has a
dorsal—ventral dimension. As the neural tube separates from the rest of the ectoderm, the side closest to the surface is dorsal,
and the deeper side is ventral.

As the spinal cord develops, the cells making up the wall of the neural tube proliferate and differentiate into the neurons
and glia of the spinal cord. The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory functions, and the ventral tissues will be
associated with motor functions.

Relating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain

Embryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the adult brain because it establishes a framework
on which more complex structures can be built. First, the neural tube establishes the anterior—posterior dimension of the
nervous system, which is called the neuraxis. The embryonic nervous system in mammals can be said to have a standard
arrangement. Humans (and other primates, to some degree) make this complicated by standing up and walking on two legs.
The anterior—posterior dimension of the neuraxis overlays the superior—inferior dimension of the body. However, there is a
major curve between the brain stem and forebrain, which is called the cephalic flexure. Because of this, the neuraxis starts
in an inferior position—the end of the spinal cord—and ends in an anterior position, the front of the cerebrum. If this is
confusing, just imagine a four-legged animal standing up on two legs. Without the flexure in the brain stem, and at the top
of the neck, that animal would be looking straight up instead of straight in front (Figure 13.4).

Figure 13.4 Human Neuraxis The mammalian nervous system is arranged with the neural tube running along an
anterior to posterior axis, from nose to tail for a four-legged animal like a dog. Humans, as two-legged animals, have
a bend in the neuraxis between the brain stem and the diencephalon, along with a bend in the neck, so that the eyes
and the face are oriented forward.

In summary, the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of the nervous system: forebrain, midbrain, and
hindbrain. These divisions are useful in certain situations, but they are not equivalent regions. The midbrain is small
compared with the hindbrain and particularly the forebrain. The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major regions
of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text. The telencephalon is the cerebrum, which is the major
portion of the human brain. The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name, because there is no better
term for it (dia- = “through”). The diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system and can be
described as the region through which all projections have to pass between the cerebrum and everything else. The brain stem
includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla, which correspond to the mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon.
The cerebellum, being a large portion of the brain, is considered a separate region. Table 13.1 connects the different stages
of development to the adult structures of the CNS.

One other benefit of considering embryonic development is that certain connections are more obvious because of
how these adult structures are related. The retina, which began as part of the diencephalon, is primarily connected to the
diencephalon. The eyes are just inferior to the anterior-most part of the cerebrum, but the optic nerve extends back to the
thalamus as the optic tract, with branches into a region of the hypothalamus. There is also a connection of the optic tract
to the midbrain, but the mesencephalon is adjacent to the diencephalon, so that is not difficult to imagine. The cerebellum
originates out of the metencephalon, and its largest white matter connection is to the pons, also from the metencephalon.
There are connections between the cerebellum and both the medulla and midbrain, which are adjacent structures in the
secondary vesicle stage of development. In the adult brain, the cerebellum seems close to the cerebrum, but there is no direct
connection between them.

Another aspect of the adult CNS structures that relates to embryonic development is the ventricles—open spaces
within the CNS where cerebrospinal fluid circulates. They are the remnant of the hollow center of the neural tube. The four
ventricles and the tubular spaces associated with them can be linked back to the hollow center of the embryonic brain (see
Table 13.1).

isorders |OF THE...

Nervous System

Early formation of the nervous system depends on the formation of the neural tube. A groove forms along the dorsal
surface of the embryo, which becomes deeper until its edges meet and close off to form the tube. If this fails to happen,
especially in the posterior region where the spinal cord forms, a developmental defect called spina bifida occurs. The
closing of the neural tube is important for more than just the proper formation of the nervous system. The surrounding
tissues are dependent on the correct development of the tube. The connective tissues surrounding the CNS can be
involved as well.

There are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Figure 13.5). The first
type, spina bifida occulta, is the mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal cord, but the
spinal cord itself is not affected. No functional differences may be noticed, which is what the word occulta means; it
is hidden spina bifida. The other two types both involve the formation of a cyst—a fluid-filled sac of the connective
tissues that cover the spinal cord called the meninges. “Meningocele” means that the meninges protrude through the
spinal column but nerves may not be involved and few symptoms are present, though complications may arise later
in life. “Myelomeningocele” means that the meninges protrude and spinal nerves are involved, and therefore severe
neurological symptoms can be present.

Often surgery to close the opening or to remove the cyst is necessary. The earlier that surgery can be performed,
the better the chances of controlling or limiting further damage or infection at the opening. For many children
with meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain, although they may experience some functional loss. Because the
myelomeningocele form of spina bifida involves more extensive damage to the nervous tissue, neurological damage
may persist, but symptoms can often be handled. Complications of the spinal cord may present later in life, but overall
life expectancy is not reduced.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/whitematter) to learn about the white matter in the cerebrum that
develops during childhood and adolescence. This is a composite of MRI images taken of the brains of people from 5
years of age through 20 years of age, demonstrating how the cerebrum changes. As the color changes to blue, the ratio
of gray matter to white matter changes. The caption for the video describes it as “less gray matter,” which is another
way of saying “more white matter.” If the brain does not finish developing until approximately 20 years of age, can
teenagers be held responsible for behaving badly?

13.2 | The Central Nervous System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Name the major regions of the adult brain
* Describe the connections between the cerebrum and brain stem through the diencephalon, and from those regions
into the spinal cord
* Recognize the complex connections within the subcortical structures of the basal nuclei
¢ Explain the arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord

The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system, and they represent the main organs of the nervous system.
The spinal cord is a single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four major regions: the cerebrum,
the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. A person’s conscious experiences are based on neural activity in the
brain. The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a specialized region in the brain. The coordination of reflexes depends
on the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord.

The Cerebrum

The iconic gray mantle of the human brain, which appears to make up most of the mass of the brain, is the cerebrum
(Figure 13.6). The wrinkled portion is the cerebral cortex, and the rest of the structure is beneath that outer covering.
There is a large separation between the two sides of the cerebrum called the longitudinal fissure. It separates the cerebrum
into two distinct halves, a right and left cerebral hemisphere. Deep within the cerebrum, the white matter of the corpus
callosum provides the major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex.

Figure 13.6 The Cerebrum_ The cerebrum is a large component of the CNS in humans, and the most obvious aspect
of it is the folded surface called the cerebral cortex.

Many of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and consciousness, are the result of cerebral
function. The complexity of the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species. The cerebrum of the most primitive
vertebrates is not much more than the connection for the sense of smell. In mammals, the cerebrum comprises the outer
gray matter that is the cortex (from the Latin word meaning “bark of a tree”) and several deep nuclei that belong to three
important functional groups. The basal nuclei are responsible for cognitive processing, the most important function being
that associated with planning movements. The basal forebrain contains nuclei that are important in learning and memory.
The limbic cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex that is part of the limbic system, a collection of structures involved
in emotion, memory, and behavior.

Cerebral Cortex

The cerebrum is covered by a continuous layer of gray matter that wraps around either side of the forebrain—the cerebral
cortex. This thin, extensive region of wrinkled gray matter is responsible for the higher functions of the nervous system. A
gyrus (plural = gyri) is the ridge of one of those wrinkles, and a sulcus (plural = sulci) is the groove between two gyri. The
pattern of these folds of tissue indicates specific regions of the cerebral cortex.

The head is limited by the size of the birth canal, and the brain must fit inside the cranial cavity of the skull. Extensive
folding in the cerebral cortex enables more gray matter to fit into this limited space. If the gray matter of the cortex were
peeled off of the cerebrum and laid out flat, its surface area would be roughly equal to one square meter.

The folding of the cortex maximizes the amount of gray matter in the cranial cavity. During embryonic development,
as the telencephalon expands within the skull, the brain goes through a regular course of growth that results in everyone’s
brain having a similar pattern of folds. The surface of the brain can be mapped on the basis of the locations of large gyri and
sulci. Using these landmarks, the cortex can be separated into four major regions, or lobes (Figure 13.7). The lateral sulcus
that separates the temporal lobe from the other regions is one such landmark. Superior to the lateral sulcus are the parietal
lobe and frontal lobe, which are separated from each other by the central sulcus. The posterior region of the cortex is the
occipital lobe, which has no obvious anatomical border between it and the parietal or temporal lobes on the lateral surface
of the brain. From the medial surface, an obvious landmark separating the parietal and occipital lobes is called the parieto-
occipital sulcus. The fact that there is no obvious anatomical border between these lobes is consistent with the functions of
these regions being interrelated.

Figure 13.7 Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex The cerebral cortex is divided into four lobes. Extensive folding increases
the surface area available for cerebral functions.

Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions, a concept known as localization
of function. In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the
microscopic anatomy—the cytoarchitecture—of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52 separate regions on the
basis of the histology of the cortex. His work resulted in a system of classification known as Brodmann’s areas, which is
still used today to describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex (Figure 13.8). The results from Brodmann’s work
on the anatomy align very well with the functional differences within the cortex. Areas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are
responsible for primary visual perception. That visual information is complex, so it is processed in the temporal and parieta
lobes as well.

The temporal lobe is associated with primary auditory sensation, known as Brodmann’s areas 41 and 42 in the superior
temporal lobe. Because regions of the temporal lobe are part of the limbic system, memory is an important function
associated with that lobe. Memory is essentially a sensory function; memories are recalled sensations such as the smell o
Mom’s baking or the sound of a barking dog. Even memories of movement are really the memory of sensory feedback from
those movements, such as stretching muscles or the movement of the skin around a joint. Structures in the temporal lobe
are responsible for establishing long-term memory, but the ultimate location of those memories is usually in the region in
which the sensory perception was processed.

The main sensation associated with the parietal lobe is somatosensation, meaning the general sensations associated
with the body. Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, the primary somatosensory cortex, which is identified
as Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, and 3. All of the tactile senses are processed in this area, including touch, pressure, tickle, pain,
itch, and vibration, as well as more general senses of the body such as proprioception and kinesthesia, which are the senses
of body position and movement, respectively.

Anterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, which is primarily associated with motor functions. The precentral
gyrus is the primary motor cortex. Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct
cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles. Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated with planned
movements. The premotor area is responsible for thinking of a movement to be made. The frontal eye fields are important
in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli. Broca’s area is responsible for the production of language,
or controlling movements responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located only on the left side. Anterior
to these regions is the prefrontal lobe, which serves cognitive functions that can be the basis of personality, short-term
memory, and consciousness. The prefrontal lobotomy is an outdated mode of treatment for personality disorders (psychiatric
conditions) that profoundly affected the personality of the patient.

Subcortical structures

Beneath the cerebral cortex are sets of nuclei known as subcortical nuclei that augment cortical processes. The nuclei of the
basal forebrain serve as the primary location for acetylcholine production, which modulates the overall activity of the cortex,
possibly leading to greater attention to sensory stimuli. Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a loss of neurons in the basal
forebrain. The hippocampus and amygdala are medial-lobe structures that, along with the adjacent cortex, are involved
in long-term memory formation and emotional responses. The basal nuclei are a set of nuclei in the cerebrum responsible
for comparing cortical processing with the general state of activity in the nervous system to influence the likelihood of
movement taking place. For example, while a student is sitting in a classroom listening to a lecture, the basal nuclei will
keep the urge to jump up and scream from actually happening. (The basal nuclei are also referred to as the basal ganglia,
although that is potentially confusing because the term ganglia is typically used for peripheral structures.)

The major structures of the basal nuclei that control movement are the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, which
are located deep in the cerebrum. The caudate is a long nucleus that follows the basic C-shape of the cerebrum from the
frontal lobe, through the parietal and occipital lobes, into the temporal lobe. The putamen is mostly deep in the anterior
regions of the frontal and parietal lobes. Together, the caudate and putamen are called the striatum. The globus pallidus is
a layered nucleus that lies just medial to the putamen; they are called the lenticular nuclei because they look like curved
pieces fitting together like lenses. The globus pallidus has two subdivisions, the external and internal segments, which are
lateral and medial, respectively. These nuclei are depicted in a frontal section of the brain in Figure 13.9.

Figure 13.9 Frontal Section of Cerebral Cortex and Basal Nuclei The major components of the basal nuclei,
shown in a frontal section of the brain, are the caudate (just lateral to the lateral ventricle), the putamen (inferior to the
caudate and separated by the large white-matter structure called the internal capsule), and the globus pallidus (medial
to the putamen).

The basal nuclei in the cerebrum are connected with a few more nuclei in the brain stem that together act as a functional
group that forms a motor pathway. Two streams of information processing take place in the basal nuclei. All input to the
basal nuclei is from the cortex into the striatum (Figure 13.10). The direct pathway is the projection of axons from the
striatum to the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The GPi/SNr then
projects to the thalamus, which projects back to the cortex. The indirect pathway is the projection of axons from the
striatum to the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), then to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and finally to GPi/SNr. The
two streams both target the GPi/SNr, but one has a direct projection and the other goes through a few intervening nuclei.
The direct pathway causes the disinhibition of the thalamus (inhibition of one cell on a target cell that then inhibits the
first cell), whereas the indirect pathway causes, or reinforces, the normal inhibition of the thalamus. The thalamus then can
either excite the cortex (as a result of the direct pathway) or fail to excite the cortex (as a result of the indirect pathway).

Figure 13.10 Connections of Basal Nuclei Input to the basal nuclei is from the cerebral cortex, which is an excitatory
connection releasing glutamate as a neurotransmitter. This input is to the striatum, or the caudate and putamen. In
the direct pathway, the striatum projects to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars
reticulata (GPi/SNr). This is an inhibitory pathway, in which GABA is released at the synapse, and the target cells
are hyperpolarized and less likely to fire. The output from the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which is an inhibitory
projection using GABA.

The switch between the two pathways is the substantia nigra pars compacta, which projects to the striatum and
releases the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine receptors are either excitatory (D1-type receptors) or inhibitory (D2-type
receptors). The direct pathway is activated by dopamine, and the indirect pathway is inhibited by dopamine. When the
substantia nigra pars compacta is firing, it signals to the basal nuclei that the body is in an active state, and movement will
be more likely. When the substantia nigra pars compacta is silent, the body is in a passive state, and movement is inhibited.
To illustrate this situation, while a student is sitting listening to a lecture, the substantia nigra pars compacta would be silent
and the student less likely to get up and walk around. Likewise, while the professor is lecturing, and walking around at the
front of the classroom, the professor’s substantia nigra pars compacta would be active, in keeping with his or her activity
level.

ganglia), which have two pathways that process information within the cerebrum. As shown in this video, the direct
pathway is the shorter pathway through the system that results in increased activity in the cerebral cortex and increased
motor activity. The direct pathway is described as resulting in “disinhibition” of the thalamus. What does disinhibition
mean? What are the two neurons doing individually to cause this?

ganglia), which have two pathways that process information within the cerebrum. As shown in this video, the indirect
pathway is the longer pathway through the system that results in decreased activity in the cerebral cortex, and therefore
less motor activity. The indirect pathway has an extra couple of connections in it, including disinhibition of the
subthalamic nucleus. What is the end result on the thalamus, and therefore on movement initiated by the cerebral
cortex?

Everyday CONNECTION

The Myth of Left Brain/Right Brain

There is a persistent myth that people are “right-brained” or “left-brained,” which is an oversimplification of an
important concept about the cerebral hemispheres. There is some lateralization of function, in which the left side of
the brain is devoted to language function and the right side is devoted to spatial and nonverbal reasoning. Whereas
these functions are predominantly associated with those sides of the brain, there is no monopoly by either side on these
functions. Many pervasive functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the cerebrum.

Some of the support for this misconception has come from studies of split brains. A drastic way to deal with a
rare and devastating neurological condition (intractable epilepsy) is to separate the two hemispheres of the brain. After
sectioning the corpus callosum, a split-brained patient will have trouble producing verbal responses on the basis of
sensory information processed on the right side of the cerebrum, leading to the idea that the left side is responsible for
language function.

However, there are well-documented cases of language functions lost from damage to the right side of the brain.
The deficits seen in damage to the left side of the brain are classified as aphasia, a loss of speech function; damage on
the right side can affect the use of language. Right-side damage can result in a loss of ability to understand figurative
aspects of speech, such as jokes, irony, or metaphors. Nonverbal aspects of speech can be affected by damage to the
right side, such as facial expression or body language, and right-side damage can lead to a “flat affect” in speech, or a
loss of emotional expression in speech—sounding like a robot when talking.

The Diencephalon

The diencephalon is the one region of the adult brain that retains its name from embryologic development. The etymology
of the word diencephalon translates to “through brain.” It is the connection between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous
system, with one exception. The rest of the brain, the spinal cord, and the PNS all send information to the cerebrum through
the diencephalon. Output from the cerebrum passes through the diencephalon. The single exception is the system associated
with olfaction, or the sense of smell, which connects directly with the cerebrum. In the earliest vertebrate species, the
cerebrum was not much more than olfactory bulbs that received peripheral information about the chemical environment (to
call it smell in these organisms is imprecise because they lived in the ocean).

The diencephalon is deep beneath the cerebrum and constitutes the walls of the third ventricle. The diencephalon can
be described as any region of the brain with “thalamus” in its name. The two major regions of the diencephalon are the
thalamus itself and the hypothalamus (Figure 13.11). There are other structures, such as the epithalamus, which contains
the pineal gland, or the subthalamus, which includes the subthalamic nucleus that is part of the basal nuclei.

Thalamus

The thalamus is a collection of nuclei that relay information between the cerebral cortex and the periphery, spinal cord, or
brain stem. All sensory information, except for the sense of smell, passes through the thalamus before processing by the
cortex. Axons from the peripheral sensory organs, or intermediate nuclei, synapse in the thalamus, and thalamic neurons
project directly to the cerebrum. It is a requisite synapse in any sensory pathway, except for olfaction. The thalamus does

not just pass the information on, it also processes that information. For example, the portion of the thalamus that receives
visual information will influence what visual stimuli are important, or what receives attention.

The cerebrum also sends information down to the thalamus, which usually communicates motor commands. This
involves interactions with the cerebellum and other nuclei in the brain stem. The cerebrum interacts with the basal nuclei,
which involves connections with the thalamus. The primary output of the basal nuclei is to the thalamus, which relays that
output to the cerebral cortex. The cortex also sends information to the thalamus that will then influence the effects of the
basal nuclei.

Hypothalamus

Inferior and slightly anterior to the thalamus is the hypothalamus, the other major region of the diencephalon. The
hypothalamus is a collection of nuclei that are largely involved in regulating homeostasis. The hypothalamus is the
executive region in charge of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system through its regulation of the anterior
pituitary gland. Other parts of the hypothalamus are involved in memory and emotion as part of the limbic system.

Thalamus

Hypothalamus

Pituitary gland

Figure 13.11 The Diencephalon The diencephalon is composed primarily of the thalamus and hypothalamus, which
together define the walls of the third ventricle. The thalami are two elongated, ovoid structures on either side of the
midline that make contact in the middle. The hypothalamus is inferior and anterior to the thalamus, culminating in a
sharp angle to which the pituitary gland is attached.

Brain Stem

The midbrain and hindbrain (composed of the pons and the medulla) are collectively referred to as the brain stem (Figure
13.12). The structure emerges from the ventral surface of the forebrain as a tapering cone that connects the brain to the
spinal cord. Attached to the brain stem, but considered a separate region of the adult brain, is the cerebellum. The midbrain
coordinates sensory representations of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory perceptual spaces. The pons is the main
connection with the cerebellum. The pons and the medulla regulate several crucial functions, including the cardiovascular
and respiratory systems and rates.

The cranial nerves connect through the brain stem and provide the brain with the sensory input and motor output
associated with the head and neck, including most of the special senses. The major ascending and descending pathways
between the spinal cord and brain, specifically the cerebrum, pass through the brain stem.

528 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

Midbrain

Pons

Medulla

Figure 13.12 The Brain Stem The brain stem comprises three regions: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla.

Midbrain

One of the original regions of the embryonic brain, the midbrain is a small region between the thalamus and pons. It is
separated into the tectum and tegmentum, from the Latin words for roof and floor, respectively. The cerebral aqueduct
passes through the center of the midbrain, such that these regions are the roof and floor of that canal.

The tectum is composed of four bumps known as the colliculi (singular = colliculus), which means “little hill” in Latin.
The inferior colliculus is the inferior pair of these enlargements and is part of the auditory brain stem pathway. Neurons
of the inferior colliculus project to the thalamus, which then sends auditory information to the cerebrum for the conscious
perception of sound. The superior colliculus is the superior pair and combines sensory information about visual space,
auditory space, and somatosensory space. Activity in the superior colliculus is related to orienting the eyes to a sound or
touch stimulus. If you are walking along the sidewalk on campus and you hear chirping, the superior colliculus coordinates
that information with your awareness of the visual location of the tree right above you. That is the correlation of auditory
and visual maps. If you suddenly feel something wet fall on your head, your superior colliculus integrates that with the
auditory and visual maps and you know that the chirping bird just relieved itself on you. You want to look up to see the
culprit, but do not.

The tegmentum is continuous with the gray matter of the rest of the brain stem. Throughout the midbrain, pons, and
medulla, the tegmentum contains the nuclei that receive and send information through the cranial nerves, as well as regions
that regulate important functions such as those of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

Pons

The word pons comes from the Latin word for bridge. It is visible on the anterior surface of the brain stem as the thick
bundle of white matter attached to the cerebellum. The pons is the main connection between the cerebellum and the brain
stem. The bridge-like white matter is only the anterior surface of the pons; the gray matter beneath that is a continuation of
the tegmentum from the midbrain. Gray matter in the tegmentum region of the pons contains neurons receiving descending
input from the forebrain that is sent to the cerebellum.

Medulla

The medulla is the region known as the myelencephalon in the embryonic brain. The initial portion of the name, “myel,”
refers to the significant white matter found in this region—especially on its exterior, which is continuous with the white
matter of the spinal cord. The tegmentum of the midbrain and pons continues into the medulla because this gray matter is
responsible for processing cranial nerve information. A diffuse region of gray matter throughout the brain stem, known as
the reticular formation, is related to sleep and wakefulness, such as general brain activity and attention.

The Cerebellum

The cerebellum, as the name suggests, is the “little brain.” It is covered in gyri and sulci like the cerebrum, and looks like a
miniature version of that part of the brain (Figure 13.13). The cerebellum is largely responsible for comparing information

from the cerebrum with sensory feedback from the periphery through the spinal cord. It accounts for approximately 10
percent of the mass of the brain.

Figure 13.13 The Cerebellum The cerebellum is situated on the posterior surface of the brain stem. Descending
input from the cerebellum enters through the large white matter structure of the pons. Ascending input from the
periphery and spinal cord enters through the fibers of the inferior olive. Output goes to the midbrain, which sends a
descending signal to the spinal cord.

Descending fibers from the cerebrum have branches that connect to neurons in the pons. Those neurons project into the
cerebellum, providing a copy of motor commands sent to the spinal cord. Sensory information from the periphery, which
enters through spinal or cranial nerves, is copied to a nucleus in the medulla known as the inferior olive. Fibers from this
nucleus enter the cerebellum and are compared with the descending commands from the cerebrum. If the primary motor
cortex of the frontal lobe sends a command down to the spinal cord to initiate walking, a copy of that instruction is sent to
the cerebellum. Sensory feedback from the muscles and joints, proprioceptive information about the movements of walking,
and sensations of balance are sent to the cerebellum through the inferior olive and the cerebellum compares them. If walking
is not coordinated, perhaps because the ground is uneven or a strong wind is blowing, then the cerebellum sends out a
corrective command to compensate for the difference between the original cortical command and the sensory feedback. The
output of the cerebellum is into the midbrain, which then sends a descending input to the spinal cord to correct the messages
going to skeletal muscles.

The Spinal Cord

The description of the CNS is concentrated on the structures of the brain, but the spinal cord is another major organ of the
system. Whereas the brain develops out of expansions of the neural tube into primary and then secondary vesicles, the spinal
cord maintains the tube structure and is only specialized into certain regions. As the spinal cord continues to develop in
the newborn, anatomical features mark its surface. The anterior midline is marked by the anterior median fissure, and the
posterior midline is marked by the posterior median sulcus. Axons enter the posterior side through the dorsal (posterior)
nerve root, which marks the posterolateral sulcus on either side. The axons emerging from the anterior side do so through
the ventral (anterior) nerve root. Note that it is common to see the terms dorsal (dorsal = “back”) and ventral (ventral =

530 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

“belly”) used interchangeably with posterior and anterior, particularly in reference to nerves and the structures of the spinal
cord. You should learn to be comfortable with both.

On the whole, the posterior regions are responsible for sensory functions and the anterior regions are associated with
motor functions. This comes from the initial development of the spinal cord, which is divided into the basal plate and the
alar plate. The basal plate is closest to the ventral midline of the neural tube, which will become the anterior face of the
spinal cord and gives rise to motor neurons. The alar plate is on the dorsal side of the neural tube and gives rise to neurons
that will receive sensory input from the periphery.

The length of the spinal cord is divided into regions that correspond to the regions of the vertebral column. The name
of a spinal cord region corresponds to the level at which spinal nerves pass through the intervertebral foramina. Immediately
adjacent to the brain stem is the cervical region, followed by the thoracic, then the lumbar, and finally the sacral region. The
spinal cord is not the full length of the vertebral column because the spinal cord does not grow significantly longer after
the first or second year, but the skeleton continues to grow. The nerves that emerge from the spinal cord pass through the
intervertebral formina at the respective levels. As the vertebral column grows, these nerves grow with it and result in a long
bundle of nerves that resembles a horse’s tail and is named the cauda equina. The sacral spinal cord is at the level of the
upper lumbar vertebral bones. The spinal nerves extend from their various levels to the proper level of the vertebral column.

Gray Horns

In cross-section, the gray matter of the spinal cord has the appearance of an ink-blot test, with the spread of the gray matter
on one side replicated on the other—a shape reminiscent of a bulbous capital “H.” As shown in Figure 13.14, the gray
matter is subdivided into regions that are referred to as horns. The posterior horn is responsible for sensory processing.
The anterior horn sends out motor signals to the skeletal muscles. The lateral horn, which is only found in the thoracic,
upper lumbar, and sacral regions, is the central component of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.

Some of the largest neurons of the spinal cord are the multipolar motor neurons in the anterior horn. The fibers that
cause contraction of skeletal muscles are the axons of these neurons. The motor neuron that causes contraction of the big
toe, for example, is located in the sacral spinal cord. The axon that has to reach all the way to the belly of that muscle may
be a meter in length. The neuronal cell body that maintains that long fiber must be quite large, possibly several hundred
micrometers in diameter, making it one of the largest cells in the body.

CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 531

White Columns

Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the spinal cord is separated into columns. Ascending
tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts
carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as
continuous bands of white matter. Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns. Between
the two anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area, are the anterior
columns. The white matter on either side of the spinal cord, between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn
neurons, are the lateral columns. The posterior columns are composed of axons of ascending tracts. The anterior and lateral
columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both ascending and descending tracts—the latter carrying
motor commands down from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery.

larger populations of neurons. What are these enlargements responsible for?

Basal Nuclei

Parkinson’s disease is a disorder of the basal nuclei, specifically of the substantia nigra, that demonstrates the effects
of the direct and indirect pathways. Parkinson’s disease is the result of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta
dying. These neurons release dopamine into the striatum. Without that modulatory influence, the basal nuclei are stuck
in the indirect pathway, without the direct pathway being activated. The direct pathway is responsible for increasing
cortical movement commands. The increased activity of the indirect pathway results in the hypokinetic disorder of
Parkinson’s disease.

Parkinson’s disease is neurodegenerative, meaning that neurons die that cannot be replaced, so there is no cure for
the disorder. Treatments for Parkinson’s disease are aimed at increasing dopamine levels in the striatum. Currently, the
most common way of doing that is by providing the amino acid L-DOPA, which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter
dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. With levels of the precursor elevated, the remaining cells of the
substantia nigra pars compacta can make more neurotransmitter and have a greater effect. Unfortunately, the patient
will become less responsive to L-DOPA treatment as time progresses, and it can cause increased dopamine levels
elsewhere in the brain, which are associated with psychosis or schizophrenia.

Compared with the nearest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee, the human has a brain that is huge. At a point in
the past, a common ancestor gave rise to the two species of humans and chimpanzees. That evolutionary history is
long and is still an area of intense study. But something happened to increase the size of the human brain relative to
the chimpanzee. Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/hugebrain) in which the author explores the current
understanding of why this happened.

According to one hypothesis about the expansion of brain size, what tissue might have been sacrificed so energy
was available to grow our larger brain? Based on what you know about that tissue and nervous tissue, why would there
be a trade-off between them in terms of energy use?

13.3 | Circulation and the Central Nervous System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the vessels that supply the CNS with blood
¢ Name the components of the ventricular system and the regions of the brain in which each is located
¢ Explain the production of cerebrospinal fluid and its flow through the ventricles
¢ Explain how a disruption in circulation would result in a stroke

The CNS is crucial to the operation of the body, and any compromise in the brain and spinal cord can lead to severe
difficulties. The CNS has a privileged blood supply, as suggested by the blood-brain barrier. The function of the tissue in
the CNS is crucial to the survival of the organism, so the contents of the blood cannot simply pass into the central nervous
tissue. To protect this region from the toxins and pathogens that may be traveling through the blood stream, there is strict
control over what can move out of the general systems and into the brain and spinal cord. Because of this privilege, the CNS
needs specialized structures for the maintenance of circulation. This begins with a unique arrangement of blood vessels
carrying fresh blood into the CNS. Beyond the supply of blood, the CNS filters that blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
which is then circulated through the cavities of the brain and spinal cord called ventricles.

Blood Supply to the Brain

A lack of oxygen to the CNS can be devastating, and the cardiovascular system has specific regulatory reflexes to ensure
that the blood supply is not interrupted. There are multiple routes for blood to get into the CNS, with specializations to
protect that blood supply and to maximize the ability of the brain to get an uninterrupted perfusion.

CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 533

Arterial Supply

The major artery carrying recently oxygenated blood away from the heart is the aorta. The very first branches off the aorta
supply the heart with nutrients and oxygen. The next branches give rise to the common carotid arteries, which further
branch into the internal carotid arteries. The external carotid arteries supply blood to the tissues on the surface of the
cranium. The bases of the common carotids contain stretch receptors that immediately respond to the drop in blood pressure
upon standing. The orthostatic reflex is a reaction to this change in body position, so that blood pressure is maintained
against the increasing effect of gravity (orthostatic means “standing up”). Heart rate increases—a reflex of the sympathetic
division of the autonomic nervous system—and this raises blood pressure.

The internal carotid artery enters the cranium through the carotid canal in the temporal bone. A second set of vessels
that supply the CNS are the vertebral arteries, which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse
foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral arteries enter the cranium through the foramen magnum of the occipital
bone. Branches off the left and right vertebral arteries merge into the anterior spinal artery supplying the anterior aspect
of the spinal cord, found along the anterior median fissure. The two vertebral arteries then merge into the basilar artery,
which gives rise to branches to the brain stem and cerebellum. The left and right internal carotid arteries and branches o:
the basilar artery all become the circle of Willis, a confluence of arteries that can maintain perfusion of the brain even i
narrowing or a blockage limits flow through one part (Figure 13.15).

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/!/bloodflow1) to see how blood flows to the brain and passes
through the circle of Willis before being distributed through the cerebrum. The circle of Willis is a specialized
arrangement of arteries that ensure constant perfusion of the cerebrum even in the event of a blockage of one of the
arteries in the circle. The animation shows the normal direction of flow through the circle of Willis to the middle
cerebral artery. Where would the blood come from if there were a blockage just posterior to the middle cerebral artery
on the left?

Venous Return

After passing through the CNS, blood returns to the circulation through a series of dural sinuses and veins (Figure 13.16).
The superior sagittal sinus runs in the groove of the longitudinal fissure, where it absorbs CSF from the meninges. The
superior sagittal sinus drains to the confluence of sinuses, along with the occipital sinuses and straight sinus, to then drain
into the transverse sinuses. The transverse sinuses connect to the sigmoid sinuses, which then connect to the jugular
veins. From there, the blood continues toward the heart to be pumped to the lungs for reoxygenation.

Protective Coverings of the Brain and Spinal Cord

which protect the brain. The dura mater is a thick fibrous layer and a strong protective sheath over the entire brain and

spinal cord. It is anchored to the inner surface of the cranium and vertebral cavity. The arachnoid mater is a membrane
of thin fibrous tissue that forms a loose sac around the CNS. Beneath the arachnoid is a thin, filamentous mesh called the
arachnoid trabeculae, which looks like a spider web, giving this layer its name. Directly adjacent to the surface of the
CNS is the pia mater, a thin fibrous membrane that follows the convolutions of gyri and sulci in the cerebral cortex and fits
into other grooves and indentations (Figure 13.17).

Figure 13.17 Meningeal Layers of Superior Sagittal Sinus The layers of the meninges in the longitudinal fissure of
the superior sagittal sinus are shown, with the dura mater adjacent to the inner surface of the cranium, the pia mater
adjacent to the surface of the brain, and the arachnoid and subarachnoid space between them. An arachnoid villus is
shown emerging into the dural sinus to allow CSF to filter back into the blood for drainage.

Dura Mater

Like a thick cap covering the brain, the dura mater is a tough outer covering. The name comes from the Latin for “tough
mother” to represent its physically protective role. It encloses the entire CNS and the major blood vessels that enter the
cranium and vertebral cavity. It is directly attached to the inner surface of the bones of the cranium and to the very end of
the vertebral cavity.

There are infoldings of the dura that fit into large crevasses of the brain. Two infoldings go through the midline
separations of the cerebrum and cerebellum; one forms a shelf-like tent between the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and the
cerebellum, and the other surrounds the pituitary gland. The dura also surrounds and supports the venous sinuses.

Arachnoid Mater

The middle layer of the meninges is the arachnoid, named for the spider-web-like trabeculae between it and the pia mater.
The arachnoid defines a sac-like enclosure around the CNS. The trabeculae are found in the subarachnoid space, which is
filled with circulating CSF. The arachnoid emerges into the dural sinuses as the arachnoid granulations, where the CSF is
filtered back into the blood for drainage from the nervous system.

The subarachnoid space is filled with circulating CSF, which also provides a liquid cushion to the brain and spinal
cord. Similar to clinical blood work, a sample of CSF can be withdrawn to find chemical evidence of neuropathology or
metabolic traces of the biochemical functions of nervous tissue.

Pia Mater

The outer surface of the CNS is covered in the thin fibrous membrane of the pia mater. It is thought to have a continuous
layer of cells providing a fluid-impermeable membrane. The name pia mater comes from the Latin for “tender mother,”
suggesting the thin membrane is a gentle covering for the brain. The pia extends into every convolution of the CNS, lining
the inside of the sulci in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. At the end of the spinal cord, a thin filament extends from the
inferior end of CNS at the upper lumbar region of the vertebral column to the sacral end of the vertebral column. Because the
spinal cord does not extend through the lower lumbar region of the vertebral column, a needle can be inserted through the
dura and arachnoid layers to withdraw CSF. This procedure is called a lumbar puncture and avoids the risk of damaging
the central tissue of the spinal cord. Blood vessels that are nourishing the central nervous tissue are between the pia mater
and the nervous tissue.

Meninges

Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the three layers of fibrous membrane that surround the CNS.
Meningitis can be caused by infection by bacteria or viruses. The particular pathogens are not special to meningitis;
it is just an inflammation of that specific set of tissues from what might be a broader infection. Bacterial meningitis
can be caused by Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, or the tuberculosis pathogen, among many others. Viral meningitis is
usually the result of common enteroviruses (such as those that cause intestinal disorders), but may be the result of the
herpes virus or West Nile virus. Bacterial meningitis tends to be more severe.

The symptoms associated with meningitis can be fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, soreness of the
neck, or severe headache. More important are the neurological symptoms, such as changes in mental state (confusion,
memory deficits, and other dementia-type symptoms). A serious risk of meningitis can be damage to peripheral
structures because of the nerves that pass through the meninges. Hearing loss is a common result of meningitis.

The primary test for meningitis is a lumbar puncture. A needle inserted into the lumbar region of the spinal column
through the dura mater and arachnoid membrane into the subarachnoid space can be used to withdraw the fluid for
chemical testing. Fatality occurs in 5 to 40 percent of children and 20 to 50 percent of adults with bacterial meningitis.
Treatment of bacterial meningitis is through antibiotics, but viral meningitis cannot be treated with antibiotics because
viruses do not respond to that type of drug. Fortunately, the viral forms are milder.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lumbarpuncture) that describes the procedure known as the lumbar
puncture, a medical procedure used to sample the CSF. Because of the anatomy of the CNS, it is a relative safe location
to insert a needle. Why is the lumbar puncture performed in the lower lumbar area of the vertebral column?

The Ventricular System

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates throughout and around the CNS. In other tissues, water and small molecules are filtered
through capillaries as the major contributor to the interstitial fluid. In the brain, CSF is produced in special structures to
perfuse through the nervous tissue of the CNS and is continuous with the interstitial fluid. Specifically, CSF circulates to
remove metabolic wastes from the interstitial fluids of nervous tissues and return them to the blood stream. The ventricles
are the open spaces within the brain where CSF circulates. In some of these spaces, CSF is produced by filtering of the blood
that is performed by a specialized membrane known as a choroid plexus. The CSF circulates through all of the ventricles to
eventually emerge into the subarachnoid space where it will be reabsorbed into the blood.

The Ventricles

There are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube,
the central canal. The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum. These ventricles are
connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina. The third ventricle is the space
between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the
midbrain. The aqueduct opens into the fourth ventricle, which is the space between the cerebellum and the pons and upper
medulla (Figure 13.18).

Figure 13.18 Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation The choroid plexus in the four ventricles produce CSF, which is
circulated through the ventricular system and then enters the subarachnoid space through the median and lateral
apertures. The CSF is then reabsorbed into the blood at the arachnoid granulations, where the arachnoid membrane
emerges into the dural sinuses.

Median aperture

Central canal

As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within the skull. The
telencephalon is the most anterior region of what was the neural tube, but cannot grow past the limit of the frontal bone of
the skull. Because the cerebrum fits into this space, it takes on a C-shaped formation, through the frontal, parietal, occipital,
and finally temporal regions. The space within the telencephalon is stretched into this same C-shape. The two ventricles are
in the left and right sides, and were at one time referred to as the first and second ventricles. The interventricular foramina
connect the frontal region of the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle.

The third ventricle is the space bounded by the medial walls of the hypothalamus and thalamus. The two thalami touch
in the center in most brains as the massa intermedia, which is surrounded by the third ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct opens
just inferior to the epithalamus and passes through the midbrain. The tectum and tegmentum of the midbrain are the roo:
and floor of the cerebral aqueduct, respectively. The aqueduct opens up into the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth
ventricle is the dorsal surface of the pons and upper medulla (that gray matter making a continuation of the tegmentum o:
the midbrain). The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord.

The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. The single median aperture and
the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around
the outside of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called
a choroid plexus. Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system)
surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF. The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the
constituents of blood. It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved
into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation

The choroid plexuses are found in all four ventricles. Observed in dissection, they appear as soft, fuzzy structures that may
still be pink, depending on how well the circulatory system is cleared in preparation of the tissue. The CSF is produced from
components extracted from the blood, so its flow out of the ventricles is tied to the pulse of cardiovascular circulation.
From the lateral ventricles, the CSF flows into the third ventricle, where more CSF is produced, and then through the
cerebral aqueduct into the fourth ventricle where even more CSF is produced. A very small amount of CSF is filtered at any
one of the plexuses, for a total of about 500 milliliters daily, but it is continuously made and pulses through the ventricular
system, keeping the fluid moving. From the fourth ventricle, CSF can continue down the central canal of the spinal cord,
but this is essentially a cul-de-sac, so more of the fluid leaves the ventricular system and moves into the subarachnoid space
through the median and lateral apertures.
Within the subarachnoid space, the CSF flows around all of the CNS, providing two important functions. As with
elsewhere in its circulation, the CSF picks up metabolic wastes from the nervous tissue and moves it out of the CNS. It also
acts as a liquid cushion for the brain and spinal cord. By surrounding the entire system in the subarachnoid space, it provides


538 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

a thin buffer around the organs within the strong, protective dura mater. The arachnoid granulations are outpocketings of the
arachnoid membrane into the dural sinuses so that CSF can be reabsorbed into the blood, along with the metabolic wastes.
From the dural sinuses, blood drains out of the head and neck through the jugular veins, along with the rest of the circulation
for blood, to be reoxygenated by the lungs and wastes to be filtered out by the kidneys (Table 13.2).

Central Nervous System

The supply of blood to the brain is crucial to its ability to perform many functions. Without a steady supply of oxygen,
and to a lesser extent glucose, the nervous tissue in the brain cannot keep up its extensive electrical activity. These
nutrients get into the brain through the blood, and if blood flow is interrupted, neurological function is compromised.

The common name for a disruption of blood supply to the brain is a stroke. It is caused by a blockage to an artery
in the brain. The blockage is from some type of embolus: a blood clot, a fat embolus, or an air bubble. When the blood
cannot travel through the artery, the surrounding tissue that is deprived starves and dies. Strokes will often result in the
loss of very specific functions. A stroke in the lateral medulla, for example, can cause a loss in the ability to swallow.
Sometimes, seemingly unrelated functions will be lost because they are dependent on structures in the same region.
Along with the swallowing in the previous example, a stroke in that region could affect sensory functions from the
face or extremities because important white matter pathways also pass through the lateral medulla. Loss of blood flow
to specific regions of the cortex can lead to the loss of specific higher functions, from the ability to recognize faces to
the ability to move a particular region of the body. Severe or limited memory loss can be the result of a temporal lobe
stroke.

Related to strokes are transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which can also be called “mini-strokes.” These are events
in which a physical blockage may be temporary, cutting off the blood supply and oxygen to a region, but not to the
extent that it causes cell death in that region. While the neurons in that area are recovering from the event, neurological
function may be lost. Function can return if the area is able to recover from the event.

Recovery from a stroke (or TIA) is strongly dependent on the speed of treatment. Often, the person who is present
and notices something is wrong must then make a decision. The mnemonic FAST helps people remember what to look
for when someone is dealing with sudden losses of neurological function. If someone complains of feeling “funny,”
check these things quickly: Look at the person’s face. Does he or she have problems moving Face muscles and making
regular facial expressions? Ask the person to raise his or her Arms above the head. Can the person lift one arm but
not the other? Has the person’s Speech changed? Is he or she slurring words or having trouble saying things? If any of
these things have happened, then it is Time to call for help.

Sometimes, treatment with blood-thinning drugs can alleviate the problem, and recovery is possible. If the tissue
is damaged, the amazing thing about the nervous system is that it is adaptable. With physical, occupational, and speech
therapy, victims of strokes can recover, or more accurately relearn, functions.

nervous system

* Describe the sensory and motor components of spinal nerves and the plexuses that they pass through

The PNS is not as contained as the CNS because it is defined as everything that is not the CNS. Some peripheral structures
are incorporated into the other organs of the body. In describing the anatomy of the PNS, it is necessary to describe the
common structures, the nerves and the ganglia, as they are found in various parts of the body. Many of the neural structures
that are incorporated into other organs are features of the digestive system; these structures are known as the enteric
nervous system and are a special subset of the PNS.

Ganglia

A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia can be categorized, for the most part, as either sensory
ganglia or autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common type of sensory ganglion is a dorsal
(posterior) root ganglion. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with axons that are sensory endings in the periphery,
such as in the skin, and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root. The ganglion is an enlargement of the nerve
root. Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers
that are the posterior nerve root (Figure 13.19). The cells of the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them
by shape. Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen surrounding—as if they were orbiting—the neuron cell
bodies.

Nervous % 20Tissue/065-2_HISTO_40X.svs/view.apml (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/spinalroot) to explore the
tissue sample in greater detail. If you zoom in on the dorsal root ganglion, you can see smaller satellite glial
cells surrounding the large cell bodies of the sensory neurons. From what structure do satellite cells derive during
embryologic development?

Another type of sensory ganglion is a cranial nerve ganglion. This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion, except
that it is associated with a cranial nerve instead of a spinal nerve. The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium,
whereas the ganglia are outside the skull. For example, the trigeminal ganglion is superficial to the temporal bone whereas
its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons region of the brain stem. The neurons of cranial nerve ganglia are also
unipolar in shape with associated satellite cells.

The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic
and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic chain ganglia constitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral
column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord. Superior to the
chain ganglia are three paravertebral ganglia in the cervical region. Three other autonomic ganglia that are related to the
sympathetic chain are the prevertebral ganglia, which are located outside of the chain but have similar functions. They
are referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral column. The neurons of these autonomic ganglia
are multipolar in shape, with dendrites radiating out around the cell body where synapses from the spinal cord neurons
are made. The neurons of the chain, paravertebral, and prevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the head and neck,
thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities to regulate the sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms.

Another group of autonomic ganglia are the terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves or sacral spinal
nerves and are responsible for regulating the parasympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms. These two sets of ganglia,
sympathetic and parasympathetic, often project to the same organs—one input from the chain ganglia and one input from
a terminal ganglion—to regulate the overall function of an organ. For example, the heart receives two inputs such as these;
one increases heart rate, and the other decreases it. The terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves are found
in the head and neck, as well as the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities, whereas the terminal ganglia that receive sacral
input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities.

Terminal ganglia below the head and neck are often incorporated into the wall of the target organ as a plexus. A plexus,
in a general sense, is a network of fibers or vessels. This can apply to nervous tissue (as in this instance) or structures
containing blood vessels (such as a choroid plexus). For example, the enteric plexus is the extensive network of axons
and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines. The enteric plexus is actually part of the enteric nervous system,
along with the gastric plexuses and the esophageal plexus. Though the enteric nervous system receives input originating
from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system, it does not require CNS input to function. In fact, it operates
independently to regulate the digestive system.

Nerves

Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures in the periphery are different than the central
counterpart, called a tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have connective tissues invested
in their structure, as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer surface of a nerve is a
surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium. Within the nerve, axons are further bundled into
fascicles, which are each surrounded by their own layer of fibrous connective tissue called perineurium. Finally, individual
axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the endoneurium (Figure 13.21). These three layers are similar to
the connective tissue sheaths for muscles. Nerves are associated with the region of the CNS to which they are connected,
either as cranial nerves connected to the brain or spinal nerves connected to the spinal cord.

Cranial Nerves

The nerves attached to the brain are the cranial nerves, which are primarily responsible for the sensory and motor functions
of the head and neck (one of these nerves targets organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as part of the parasympathetic
nervous system). There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for “Cranial Nerve,” using
Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both,
meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the
brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or
neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed
nerves.

Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to
remember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, “On Old Olympus’ Towering Tops/A Finn And
German Viewed Some Hops,” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each
nerve. The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming. An exercise
to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance. The names of
the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function, their source (sensory ganglion or
motor nucleus), and their target (sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle). They are listed here with a brief explanation of each
nerve (Figure 13.23).

544 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

The olfactory nerve and optic nerve are responsible for the sense of smell and vision, respectively. The oculomotor
nerve is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles. It is also responsible for lifting
the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for pupillary constriction. The trochlear nerve and the abducens nerve
are both responsible for eye movement, but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles. The trigeminal nerve is
responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face and controlling the muscles of mastication. The facial nerve is responsible
for the muscles involved in facial expressions, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. The
vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance. The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible
for controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva.
The vagus nerve is responsible for contributing to homeostatic control of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal
cavities. The spinal accessory nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck, along with cervical spinal
nerves. The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue.

Three of the cranial nerves also contain autonomic fibers, and a fourth is almost purely a component of the autonomic
system. The oculomotor, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves contain fibers that contact autonomic ganglia. The oculomotor
fibers initiate pupillary constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both initiate salivation. The vagus nerve
primarily targets autonomic ganglia in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.

question is what caused it originally. How can that be cured? The loss of vision comes from swelling around the optic

CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 545

Another important aspect of the cranial nerves that lends itself to a mnemonic is the functional role each nerve plays.
The nerves fall into one of three basic groups. They are sensory, motor, or both (see Table 13.3). The sentence, “Some Say
Marry Money But My Brother Says Brains Beauty Matter More,” corresponds to the basic function of each nerve. The first,
second, and eighth nerves are purely sensory: the olfactory (CNI), optic (CNII), and vestibulocochlear (CNVIII) nerves.
The three eye-movement nerves are all motor: the oculomotor (CNIII), trochlear (CNIV), and abducens (CNVI). The spinal
accessory (CNXI) and hypoglossal (CNXII) nerves are also strictly motor. The remainder of the nerves contain both sensory
and motor fibers. They are the trigeminal (CNV), facial (CNVID), glossopharyngeal (CNIX), and vagus (CNX) nerves. The
nerves that convey both are often related to each other. The trigeminal and facial nerves both concern the face; one concerns
the sensations and the other concerns the muscle movements. The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are both responsible
for conveying gustatory, or taste, sensations as well as controlling salivary glands. The vagus nerve is involved in visceral
responses to taste, namely the gag reflex. This is not an exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do, but there is a
thread of relation between them.

546 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

Spinal Nerves

The nerves connected to the spinal cord are the spinal nerves. The arrangement of these nerves is much more regular than
that of the cranial nerves. All of the spinal nerves are combined sensory and motor axons that separate into two nerve roots.
The sensory axons enter the spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root. The motor fibers, both somatic and autonomic, emerge as
the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlargement of the spinal nerve.

There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges. There are eight pairs of
cervical nerves designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five pairs of lumbar nerves designated
L1 to LS, five pairs of sacral nerves designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The nerves are numbered from
the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from the vertebral column through the intervertebral foramen at its
level. The first nerve, C1, emerges between the first cervical vertebra and the occipital bone. The second nerve, C2, emerges
between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The same occurs for C3 to C7, but C8 emerges between the seventh cervical
vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that
has the same designation and the next vertebra in the column. The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the
length of that unique vertebra.

Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the periphery. The nerves in the periphery are
not straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different
courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a systemic nerve. This occurs at four places along
the length of the vertebral column, each identified as a nerve plexus, whereas the other spinal nerves directly correspond
to nerves at their respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe networks of nerve fibers with no
associated cell bodies.

Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level
(Figure 13.24). The cervical plexus is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves
in the posterior neck and head, as well as the phrenic nerve, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic
cavity. The other plexus from the cervical level is the brachial plexus. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through
this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial suggests. A large nerve from this plexus is the radial
nerve from which the axillary nerve branches to go to the armpit region. The radial nerve continues through the arm and is
paralleled by the ulnar nerve and the median nerve. The lumbar plexus arises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives
rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg. The femoral nerve is one of the major nerves from this
plexus, which gives rise to the saphenous nerve as a branch that extends through the anterior lower leg. The sacral plexus
comes from the lower lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and the sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most significant systemic nerve to come
from this plexus is the sciatic nerve, which is a combination of the tibial nerve and the fibular nerve. The sciatic nerve
extends across the hip joint and is most commonly associated with the condition sciatica, which is the result of compression
or irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it.

These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise to certain systemic nerves, but they contain
fibers that serve sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions. This means that some fibers extend from cutaneous
or other peripheral sensory surfaces and send action potentials into the CNS. Those are axons of sensory neurons in the
dorsal root ganglia that enter the spinal cord through the dorsal nerve root. Other fibers are the axons of motor neurons
of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which emerge in the ventral nerve root and send action potentials to cause skeletal
muscles to contract in their target regions. For example, the radial nerve contains fibers of cutaneous sensation in the arm,
as well as motor fibers that move muscles in the arm.

Spinal nerves of the thoracic region, T2 through T11, are not part of the plexuses but rather emerge and give rise to the
intercostal nerves found between the ribs, which articulate with the vertebrae surrounding the spinal nerve.

Ag/\ng AND THE...

Nervous System

Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell. It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed, usually because
of blunt force trauma to the head. The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of
approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular basis. The new neurons extend their axons
into the CNS by growing along the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve. The ability of these neurons to be replaced is
lost with age. Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head, but rather a slow loss of the sensory
neurons with no new neurons born to replace them.

Smell is an important sense, especially for the enjoyment of food. There are only five tastes sensed by the tongue,
and two of them are generally thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter). The rich sensory experience of food is
the result of odor molecules associated with the food, both as food is moved into the mouth, and therefore passes under
the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up the pharynx into the posterior nasal cavity.
Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food.

As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in. Without the sense of smell, many
sufferers complain of food tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be sensed
on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt. The problem with this solution, however, is that this increases
sodium intake, which can lead to cardiovascular problems through water retention and the associated increase in blood
pressure.

CHAPTER REVIEW

13.1 The Embryologic Perspective

The development of the nervous system starts early in embryonic development. The outer layer of the embryo, the ectoderm,
gives rise to the skin and the nervous system. A specialized region of this layer, the neuroectoderm, becomes a groove that
folds in and becomes the neural tube beneath the dorsal surface of the embryo. The anterior end of the neural tube develops
into the brain, and the posterior region becomes the spinal cord. Tissues at the edges of the neural groove, when it closes
off, are called the neural crest and migrate through the embryo to give rise to PNS structures as well as some non-nervous
tissues.
The brain develops from this early tube structure and gives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. As the neural tube
grows and differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions
the adult brain. Later in development, two of these three vesicles differentiate further, resulting in five vesicles. Those
five vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions of the adult brain. The cerebrum is formed directly from the
telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only region that keeps its embryonic name. The mesencephalon, metencephalon,
and myelencephalon become the brain stem. The cerebellum also develops from the metencephalon and is a separate region
of the adult brain.

The spinal cord develops out of the rest of the neural tube and retains the tube structure, with the nervous tissue
thickening and the hollow center becoming a very small central canal through the cord. The rest of the hollow center of the
neural tube corresponds to open spaces within the brain called the ventricles, where cerebrospinal fluid is found.

°

13.2 The Central Nervous System

The adult brain is separated into four major regions: the cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum.
The cerebrum is the largest portion and contains the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei. It is divided into two halves by
the longitudinal fissure.

The cortex is separated into the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is responsible for
motor functions, from planning movements through executing commands to be sent to the spinal cord and periphery. The
most anterior portion of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with aspects of personality through its
influence on motor responses in decision-making.


556 CHAPTER 13 | ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

The other lobes are responsible for sensory functions. The parietal lobe is where somatosensation is processed. The
occipital lobe is where visual processing begins, although the other parts of the brain can contribute to visual function. The
temporal lobe contains the cortical area for auditory processing, but also has regions crucial for memory formation.

Nuclei beneath the cerebral cortex, known as the subcortical nuclei, are responsible for augmenting cortical functions.
The basal nuclei receive input from cortical areas and compare it with the general state of the individual through the activity
of a dopamine-releasing nucleus. The output influences the activity of part of the thalamus that can then increase or decrease
cortical activity that often results in changes to motor commands. The basal forebrain is responsible for modulating cortical
activity in attention and memory. The limbic system includes deep cerebral nuclei that are responsible for emotion and
memory.

The diencephalon includes the thalamus and the hypothalamus, along with some other structures. The thalamus is
a relay between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system. The hypothalamus coordinates homeostatic functions
through the autonomic and endocrine systems.

The brain stem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. It controls the head and neck region of the body
through the cranial nerves. There are control centers in the brain stem that regulate the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems.

The cerebellum is connected to the brain stem, primarily at the pons, where it receives a copy of the descending input
from the cerebrum to the spinal cord. It can compare this with sensory feedback input through the medulla and send output
through the midbrain that can correct motor commands for coordination.

13.3 Circulation and the Central Nervous System

The CNS has a privileged blood supply established by the blood-brain barrier. Establishing this barrier are anatomical
structures that help to protect and isolate the CNS. The arterial blood to the brain comes from the internal carotid and
vertebral arteries, which both contribute to the unique circle of Willis that provides constant perfusion of the brain even
if one of the blood vessels is blocked or narrowed. That blood is eventually filtered to make a separate medium, the CSF,
that circulates within the spaces of the brain and then into the surrounding space defined by the meninges, the protective
covering of the brain and spinal cord.

The blood that nourishes the brain and spinal cord is behind the glial-cell-enforced blood-brain barrier, which limits
the exchange of material from blood vessels with the interstitial fluid of the nervous tissue. Thus, metabolic wastes are
collected in cerebrospinal fluid that circulates through the CNS. This fluid is produced by filtering blood at the choroid
plexuses in the four ventricles of the brain. It then circulates through the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space, between
the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. From the arachnoid granulations, CSF is reabsorbed into the blood, removing the
waste from the privileged central nervous tissue.

The blood, now with the reabsorbed CSF, drains out of the cranium through the dural sinuses. The dura mater is the
tough outer covering of the CNS, which is anchored to the inner surface of the cranial and vertebral cavities. It surrounds
the venous space known as the dural sinuses, which connect to the jugular veins, where blood drains from the head and
neck.

13.4 The Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS is composed of the groups of neurons (ganglia) and bundles of axons (nerves) that are outside of the brain and
spinal cord. Ganglia are of two types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain unipolar sensory neurons and are
found on the dorsal root of all spinal nerves as well as associated with many of the cranial nerves. Autonomic ganglia are in
the sympathetic chain, the associated paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia, or in terminal ganglia near or within the organs
controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

Nerves are classified as cranial nerves or spinal nerves on the basis of their connection to the brain or spinal cord,
respectively. The twelve cranial nerves can be strictly sensory in function, strictly motor in function, or a combination of the
two functions. Sensory fibers are axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information into the brain and target sensory
nuclei. Motor fibers are axons of motor neurons in motor nuclei of the brain stem and target skeletal muscles of the head
and neck. Spinal nerves are all mixed nerves with both sensory and motor fibers. Spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord
and reorganize through plexuses, which then give rise to systemic nerves. Thoracic spinal nerves are not part of any plexus,
but give rise to the intercostal nerves directly.

INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS

1. Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/
braindevel) to examine the development of the brain,
starting with the neural tube. As the anterior end of the
neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles
that establish the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Those
structures continue to develop throughout the rest of
embryonic development and into adolescence. They are the
basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain. How

would you describe the difference in the relative sizes of the
three regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th
embryonic day) brain and the adult brain?

2. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/

cerebrum that develops during childhood and adolescence.
This is a composite of MRI images taken of the brains

of people from 5 years of age through 20 years of age,
demonstrating how the cerebrum changes. As the color
changes to blue, the ratio of gray matter to white matter
changes. The caption for the video describes it as “less gray
matter,” which is another way of saying “more white
matter.” If the brain does not finish developing until
approximately 20 years of age, can teenagers be held
responsible for behaving badly?

3. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
basalnucleil) to learn about the basal nuclei (also known
as the basal ganglia), which have two pathways that process
information within the cerebrum. As shown in this video,
the direct pathway is the shorter pathway through the system
that results in increased activity in the cerebral cortex and
increased motor activity. The direct pathway is described
as resulting in “disinhibition” of the thalamus. What does
disinhibition mean? What are the two neurons doing
individually to cause this?

indirect pathway is the longer pathway through the system
that results in decreased activity in the cerebral cortex, and
therefore less motor activity. The indirect pathway has an
extra couple of connections in it, including disinhibition
of the subthalamic nucleus. What is the end result on the
thalamus, and therefore on movement initiated by the
cerebral cortex?

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 561

14 | THE BRAIN AND
CRANIAL NERVES

When high temperature is sensed in the skin, a reflexive withdrawal is initiated by the
muscles of the arm. Sensory neurons are activated by a stimulus, which is sent to the central nervous system, and a
motor response is sent out to the skeletal muscles that control this movement.

Introduction

Chapter Objectives

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Describe the components of the somatic nervous system

* Name the modalities and submodalities of the sensory systems

¢ Distinguish between general and special senses

* Describe regions of the central nervous system that contribute to somatic functions
¢ Explain the stimulus-response motor pathway

The somatic nervous system is traditionally considered a division within the peripheral nervous system. However, this
misses an important point: somatic refers to a functional division, whereas peripheral refers to an anatomic division. The
somatic nervous system is responsible for our conscious perception of the environment and for our voluntary responses

562 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES

to that perception by means of skeletal muscles. Peripheral sensory neurons receive input from environmental stimuli, but
the neurons that produce motor responses originate in the central nervous system. The distinction between the structures
(i.e., anatomy) of the peripheral and central nervous systems and functions (i.e., physiology) of the somatic and autonomic
systems can most easily be demonstrated through a simple reflex action. When you touch a hot stove, you pull your hand
away. Sensory receptors in the skin sense extreme temperature and the early signs of tissue damage. This triggers an action
potential, which travels along the sensory fiber from the skin, through the dorsal spinal root to the spinal cord, and directly
activates a ventral horn motor neuron. That neuron sends a signal along its axon to excite the biceps brachii, causing
contraction of the muscle and flexion of the forearm at the elbow to withdraw the hand from the hot stove. The withdrawal
reflex has more components, such as inhibiting the opposing muscle and balancing posture while the arm is forcefully
withdrawn, which will be further explored at the end of this chapter.

The basic withdrawal reflex explained above includes sensory input (the painful stimulus), central processing (the
synapse in the spinal cord), and motor output (activation of a ventral motor neuron that causes contraction of the biceps
brachii). Expanding the explanation of the withdrawal reflex can include inhibition of the opposing muscle, or cross
extension, either of which increase the complexity of the example by involving more central neurons. A collateral branch
of the sensory axon would inhibit another ventral horn motor neuron so that the triceps brachii do not contract and slow the
withdrawal down. The cross extensor reflex provides a counterbalancing movement on the other side of the body, which
requires another collateral of the sensory axon to activate contraction of the extensor muscles in the contralateral limb.

A more complex example of somatic function is conscious muscle movement. For example, reading of this text starts
with visual sensory input to the retina, which then projects to the thalamus, and on to the cerebral cortex. A sequence of
regions of the cerebral cortex process the visual information, starting in the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobe,
and resulting in the conscious perception of these letters. Subsequent cognitive processing results in understanding of the
content. As you continue reading, regions of the cerebral cortex in the frontal lobe plan how to move the eyes to follow
the lines of text. The output from the cortex causes activity in motor neurons in the brain stem that cause movement of the
extraocular muscles through the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. This example also includes sensory input (the retinal
projection to the thalamus), central processing (the thalamus and subsequent cortical activity), and motor output (activation
of neurons in the brain stem that lead to coordinated contraction of extraocular muscles).

14.1 | Sensory Perception

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe different types of sensory receptors
¢ Describe the structures responsible for the special senses of taste, smell, hearing, balance, and vision
¢ Distinguish how different tastes are transduced
¢ Describe the means of mechanoreception for hearing and balance
¢ List the supporting structures around the eye and describe the structure of the eyeball
* Describe the processes of phototransduction

A major role of sensory receptors is to help us learn about the environment around us, or about the state of our internal
environment. Stimuli from varying sources, and of different types, are received and changed into the electrochemical signals
of the nervous system. This occurs when a stimulus changes the cell membrane potential of a sensory neuron. The stimulus
causes the sensory cell to produce an action potential that is relayed into the central nervous system (CNS), where it is
integrated with other sensory information—or sometimes higher cognitive functions—to become a conscious perception of
that stimulus. The central integration may then lead to a motor response.

Describing sensory function with the term sensation or perception is a deliberate distinction. Sensation is the activation
of sensory receptor cells at the level of the stimulus. Perception is the central processing of sensory stimuli into a meaningful
pattern. Perception is dependent on sensation, but not all sensations are perceived. Receptors are the cells or structures that
detect sensations. A receptor cell is changed directly by a stimulus. A transmembrane protein receptor is a protein in the cell
membrane that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of ion channels or changes in
the cell signaling processes. Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called ligands. For example, a molecule
in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors,
are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane,
and can generate an action potential or a graded potential in the sensory neurons.

Sensory Receptors

Stimuli in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the peripheral nervous system. Different types of stimuli
are sensed by different types of receptor cells. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different
criteria: cell type, position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position
in relation to stimuli they sense. They can also be classified functionally on the basis of the transduction of stimuli, or how
the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell membrane potential.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 563

Structural Receptor Types

The cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a neuron that has a free nerve ending, with
dendrites embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the
sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in connective tissue that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specialized receptor cell,
which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus (Figure 14.2). The pain and temperature
receptors in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings. Also located in the dermis of the
skin are lamellated corpuscles, neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch. The cells in the
retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor, a photoreceptor.

Figure 14.2 Receptor Classification by Cell Type Receptor cell types can be classified on the basis of their
structure. Sensory neurons can have either (a) free nerve endings or (b) encapsulated endings. Photoreceptors in the
eyes, such as rod cells, are examples of (c) specialized receptor cells. These cells release neurotransmitters onto a
bipolar cell, which then synapses with the optic nerve neurons.

Another way that receptors can be classified is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An exteroceptor is a
receptor that is located near a stimulus in the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in
the skin. An interoceptor is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the
increase in blood pressure in the aorta or carotid sinus. Finally, a proprioceptor is a receptor located near a moving part of
the body, such as a muscle, that interprets the positions of the tissues as they move.

Functional Receptor Types

A third classification of receptors is by how the receptor transduces stimuli into membrane potential changes. Stimuli are
of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and macromolecules that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these
chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor
cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only
electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack,
such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.

Receptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. Chemical stimuli can
be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object’s taste or smell. Osmoreceptors
respond to solute concentrations of body fluids. Additionally, pain is primarily a chemical sense that interprets the presence
of chemicals from tissue damage, or similar intense stimuli, through a nociceptor. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and
vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor.
Another physical stimulus that has its own type of receptor is temperature, which is sensed through a thermoreceptor that
is either sensitive to temperatures above (heat) or below (cold) normal body temperature.

Sensory Modalities

Ask anyone what the senses are, and they are likely to list the five major senses—taste, smell, touch, hearing, and sight.
However, these are not all of the senses. The most obvious omission from this list is balance. Also, what is referred to
simply as touch can be further subdivided into pressure, vibration, stretch, and hair-follicle position, on the basis of the
type of mechanoreceptors that perceive these touch sensations. Other overlooked senses include temperature perception by
thermoreceptors and pain perception by nociceptors.

Within the realm of physiology, senses can be classified as either general or specific. A general sense is one that is
distributed throughout the body and has receptor cells within the structures of other organs. Mechanoreceptors in the skin,
muscles, or the walls of blood vessels are examples of this type. General senses often contribute to the sense of touch, as
described above, or to proprioception (body movement) and kinesthesia (body movement), or to a visceral sense, which

564 CHAPTER 14| THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES

is most important to autonomic functions. A special sense is one that has a specific organ devoted to it, namely the eye,
inner ear, tongue, or nose.

Each of the senses is referred to as a sensory modality. Modality refers to the way that information is encoded, which
is similar to the idea of transduction. The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced.
The chemical senses are taste and smell. The general sense that is usually referred to as touch includes chemical sensation
in the form of nociception, or pain. Pressure, vibration, muscle stretch, and the movement of hair by an external stimulus,
are all sensed by mechanoreceptors. Hearing and balance are also sensed by mechanoreceptors. Finally, vision involves the
activation of photoreceptors.

Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the five major
senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality represents the
sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sense of touch, which is known as somatosensation, can
be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement.

Gustation (Taste)

Only a few recognized submodalities exist within the sense of taste, or gustation. Until recently, only four tastes were
recognized: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Research at the turn of the 20th century led to recognition of the fifth taste, umami,
during the mid-1980s. Umami is a Japanese word that means “delicious taste,” and is often translated to mean savory. Very
recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste for fats, or lipids.

Gustation is the special sense associated with the tongue. The surface of the tongue, along with the rest of the oral
cavity, is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. Raised bumps called papillae (singular = papilla) contain the structures
for gustatory transduction. There are four types of papillae, based on their appearance (Figure 14.3): circumvallate, foliate,
filiform, and fungiform. Within the structure of the papillae are taste buds that contain specialized gustatory receptor
cells for the transduction of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are
ingested, and they release neurotransmitters based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the
gustatory cells can activate sensory neurons in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 565

Salty taste is simply the perception of sodium ions (Na’) in the saliva. When you eat something salty, the salt crystals

dissociate into the component ions Na* and CI, which dissolve into the saliva in your mouth. The Na” concentration
becomes high outside the gustatory cells, creating a strong concentration gradient that drives the diffusion of the ion into the

cells. The entry of Na” into these cells results in the depolarization of the cell membrane and the generation of a receptor
potential.

Sour taste is the perception of H® concentration. Just as with sodium ions in salty flavors, these hydrogen ions enter
the cell and trigger depolarization. Sour flavors are, essentially, the perception of acids in our food. Increasing hydrogen ion
concentrations in the saliva (lowering saliva pH) triggers progressively stronger graded potentials in the gustatory cells. For
example, orange juice—which contains citric acid—will taste sour because it has a pH value of approximately 3. Of course,
it is often sweetened so that the sour taste is masked.

The first two tastes (salty and sour) are triggered by the cations Na’ and H”. The other tastes result from food
molecules binding to a G protein-coupled receptor. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to
depolarization of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of glucose
dissolved in the saliva. Other monosaccharides such as fructose, or artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet™),
saccharine, or sucralose (Splenda™) also activate the sweet receptors. The affinity for each of these molecules varies, and
some will taste sweeter than glucose because they bind to the G protein—coupled receptor differently.

Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein-coupled receptors. However, there are a number
of different ways in which this can happen because there are a large diversity of bitter-tasting molecules. Some bitter
molecules depolarize gustatory cells, whereas others hyperpolarize gustatory cells. Likewise, some bitter molecules increase
G protein activation within the gustatory cells, whereas other bitter molecules decrease G protein activation. The specific
response depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor.

One major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing molecules that often
have a basic pH. Alkaloids are commonly found in bitter-tasting plant products, such as coffee, hops (in beer), tannins (in
wine), tea, and aspirin. By containing toxic alkaloids, the plant is less susceptible to microbe infection and less attractive to
herbivores.

Therefore, the function of bitter taste may primarily be related to stimulating the gag reflex to avoid ingesting poisons.
Because of this, many bitter foods that are normally ingested are often combined with a sweet component to make them
more palatable (cream and sugar in coffee, for example). The highest concentration of bitter receptors appear to be in the
posterior tongue, where a gag reflex could still spit out poisonous food.

The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of
G protein-coupled receptors by a specific molecule. The molecule that activates this receptor is the amino acid L-glutamate.
Therefore, the umami flavor is often perceived while eating protein-rich foods. Not surprisingly, dishes that contain meat
are often described as savory.

Once the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release neurotransmitters onto the dendrites of
sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within
the vagus nerve dedicated to the gag reflex. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The
glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus nerve connects to taste
buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the pharynx, which are more sensitive to noxious stimuli such as
bitterness.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/DanielleReed) to learn about Dr. Danielle Reed of the Monell
Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who became interested in science at an early age because of her
sensory experiences. She recognized that her sense of taste was unique compared with other people she knew. Now,
she studies the genetic differences between people and their sensitivities to taste stimuli. In the video, there is a brief
image of a person sticking out their tongue, which has been covered with a colored dye. This is how Dr. Reed is able
to visualize and count papillae on the surface of the tongue. People fall into two groups known as “tasters” and “non-
tasters” based on the density of papillae on their tongue, which also indicates the number of taste buds. Non-tasters can
taste food, but they are not as sensitive to certain tastes, such as bitterness. Dr. Reed discovered that she is a non-taster,
which explains why she perceived bitterness differently than other people she knew. Are you very sensitive to tastes?
Can you see any similarities among the members of your family?

Olfaction (Smell)

Like taste, the sense of smell, or olfaction, is also responsive to chemical stimuli. The olfactory receptor neurons are located
in a small region within the superior nasal cavity (Figure 14.4). This region is referred to as the olfactory epithelium and
contains bipolar sensory neurons. Each olfactory sensory neuron has dendrites that extend from the apical surface of the
epithelium into the mucus lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the nose, they pass over the olfactory
epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the
mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant—protein complex binds to a receptor protein within
the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein-coupled, and will produce a graded membrane
potential in the olfactory neurons.

The axon of an olfactory neuron extends from the basal surface of the epithelium, through an olfactory foramen in
the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and into the brain. The group of axons called the olfactory tract connect to the
olfactory bulb on the ventral surface of the frontal lobe. From there, the axons split to travel to several brain regions. Some
travel to the cerebrum, specifically to the primary olfactory cortex that is located in the inferior and medial areas of the
temporal lobe. Others project to structures within the limbic system and hypothalamus, where smells become associated
with long-term memory and emotional responses. This is how certain smells trigger emotional memories, such as the smell
of food associated with one’s birthplace. Smell is the one sensory modality that does not synapse in the thalamus before
connecting to the cerebral cortex. This intimate connection between the olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one
reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and emotion.

The nasal epithelium, including the olfactory cells, can be harmed by airborne toxic chemicals. Therefore, the olfactory
neurons are regularly replaced within the nasal epithelium, after which the axons of the new neurons must find their
appropriate connections in the olfactory bulb. These new axons grow along the axons that are already in place in the cranial
nerve.

isorders |OF THE...

Olfactory System: Anosmia

Blunt force trauma to the face, such as that common in many car accidents, can lead to the loss of the olfactory
nerve, and subsequently, loss of the sense of smell. This condition is known as anosmia. When the frontal lobe of
the brain moves relative to the ethmoid bone, the olfactory tract axons may be sheared apart. Professional fighters
often experience anosmia because of repeated trauma to face and head. In addition, certain pharmaceuticals, such as
antibiotics, can cause anosmia by killing all the olfactory neurons at once. If no axons are in place within the olfactory
nerve, then the axons from newly formed olfactory neurons have no guide to lead them to their connections within
the olfactory bulb. There are temporary causes of anosmia, as well, such as those caused by inflammatory responses
related to respiratory infections or allergies.

Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require
additional spice and seasoning levels for food to be tasted. Anosmia may also be related to some presentations of mild
depression, because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair.

The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia. This
explains why some elderly people salt their food more than younger people do. However, this increased sodium intake
can increase blood volume and blood pressure, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.

Audition (Hearing)

Hearing, or audition, is the transduction of sound waves into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of
the ear (Figure 14.5). The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the auricle. Some sources
will also refer to this structure as the pinna, though that term is more appropriate for a structure that can be moved, such
as the external ear of a cat. The C-shaped curves of the auricle direct sound waves toward the auditory canal. The canal
enters the skull through the external auditory meatus of the temporal bone. At the end of the auditory canal is the tympanic
membrane, or ear drum, which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane
are often referred to as the external ear. The middle ear consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the
ossicles. The three ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer,
anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn,
articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the inner ear, where the sound waves will be transduced into a
neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the pharynx through the Eustachian tube, which helps equilibrate air pressure
across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract
during swallowing or yawning.

Figure 14.5 Structures of the Ear The external ear contains the auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. The
middle ear contains the ossicles and is connected to the pharynx by the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the
cochlea and vestibule, which are responsible for audition and equilibrium, respectively.

The inner ear is often described as a bony labyrinth, as it is composed of a series of canals embedded within the
temporal bone. It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and balance,
respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber bundles.
However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the vestibulocochlear nerve.
Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which contains the sensory neurons of
the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is attached to
the stapes through the oval window.

The oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli. The
scala vestibuli extends from the oval window, travelling above the cochlear duct, which is the central cavity of the cochlea
that contains the sound-transducing neurons. At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves over the top of
the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the cochlea, this time travelling
under the cochlear duct. The scala tympani ends at the round window, which is covered by a membrane that contains the
fluid within the scala. As vibrations of the ossicles travel through the oval window, the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala
tympani moves in a wave-like motion. The frequency of the fluid waves match the frequencies of the sound waves (Figure
14.6). The membrane covering the round window will bulge out or pucker in with the movement of the fluid within the
scala tympani.

Figure 14.6 Transmission of Sound Waves to Cochlea A sound wave causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate.
This vibration is amplified as it moves across the malleus, incus, and stapes. The amplified vibration is picked up by
the oval window causing pressure waves in the fluid of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The complexity of the
pressure waves is determined by the changes in amplitude and frequency of the sound waves entering the ear.

A cross-sectional view of the cochlea shows that the scala vestibuli and scala tympani run along both sides of the
cochlear duct (Figure 14.7). The cochlear duct contains several organs of Corti, which tranduce the wave motion of the
two scala into neural signals. The organs of Corti lie on top of the basilar membrane, which is the side of the cochlear duct
located between the organs of Corti and the scala tympani. As the fluid waves move through the scala vestibuli and scala
tympani, the basilar membrane moves at a specific spot, depending on the frequency of the waves. Higher frequency waves
move the region of the basilar membrane that is close to the base of the cochlea. Lower frequency waves move the region
of the basilar membrane that is near the tip of the cochlea.

hair cells, is adjacent to the scala tympani, where it sits atop the basilar membrane.

The organs of Corti contain hair cells, which are named for the hair-like stereocilia extending from the cell’s apical
surfaces (Figure 14.8). The stereocilia are an array of microvilli-like structures arranged from tallest to shortest. Protein
fibers tether adjacent hairs together within each array, such that the array will bend in response to movements of the basilar

membrane. The stereocilia extend up from the hair cells to the overlying tectorial membrane, which is attached medially
to the organ of Corti. When the pressure waves from the scala move the basilar membrane, the tectorial membrane slides
across the stereocilia. This bends the stereocilia either toward or away from the tallest member of each array. When the
stereocilia bend toward the tallest member of their array, tension in the protein tethers opens ion channels in the hair cell
membrane. This will depolarize the hair cell membrane, triggering nerve impulses that travel down the afferent nerve fibers
attached to the hair cells. When the stereocilia bend toward the shortest member of their array, the tension on the tethers
slackens and the ion channels close. When no sound is present, and the stereocilia are standing straight, a small amount of
tension still exists on the tethers, keeping the membrane potential of the hair cell slightly depolarized.

explore the tissue sample in greater detail. The basilar membrane is the thin membrane that extends from the central
core of the cochlea to the edge. What is anchored to this membrane so that they can be activated by movement of the
fluids within the cochlea?

As stated above, a given region of the basilar membrane will only move if the incoming sound is at a specific
frequency. Because the tectorial membrane only moves where the basilar membrane moves, the hair cells in this region
will also only respond to sounds of this specific frequency. Therefore, as the frequency of a sound changes, different hair
cells are activated all along the basilar membrane. The cochlea encodes auditory stimuli for frequencies between 20 and
20,000 Hz, which is the range of sound that human ears can detect. The unit of Hertz measures the frequency of sound
waves in terms of cycles produced per second. Frequencies as low as 20 Hz are detected by hair cells at the apex, or tip, of
the cochlea. Frequencies in the higher ranges of 20 KHz are encoded by hair cells at the base of the cochlea, close to the
round and oval windows (Figure 14.10). Most auditory stimuli contain a mixture of sounds at a variety of frequencies and
intensities (represented by the amplitude of the sound wave). The hair cells along the length of the cochlear duct, which are
each sensitive to a particular frequency, allow the cochlea to separate auditory stimuli by frequency, just as a prism separates
visible light into its component colors.

activated only by low frequencies.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear1) to learn more about how the structures of the ear convert sound
waves into a neural signal by moving the “hairs,” or stereocilia, of the cochlear duct. Specific locations along the length
of the duct encode specific frequencies, or pitches. The brain interprets the meaning of the sounds we hear as music,
speech, noise, etc. Which ear structures are responsible for the amplification and transfer of sound from the external
ear to the inner ear?

= stax

Watch this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear2) to learn more about the inner ear and to see the cochlea
unroll, with the base at the back of the image and the apex at the front. Specific wavelengths of sound cause specific
regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate, much like the keys of a piano produce sound at different frequencies. Based
on the animation, where do frequencies—from high to low pitches—cause activity in the hair cells within the cochlear
duct?

Equilibrium (Balance)

Along with audition, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium, the sense of balance. A
similar mechanoreceptor—a hair cell with stereocilia—senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are
in motion. These cells are located within the vestibule of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the utricle and saccule,
whereas head movement is sensed by the semicircular canals. The neural signals generated in the vestibular ganglion are
transmitted through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem and cerebellum.

The utricle and saccule are both largely composed of macula tissue (plural = maculae). The macula is composed of hair
cells surrounded by support cells. The stereocilia of the hair cells extend into a viscous gel called the otolith (Figure 14.11).
The otolith contains calcium carbonate crystals, making it denser and giving it greater inertia than the macula. Therefore,
gravity will cause the otolith to move separately from the macula in response to head movements. Tilting the head causes
the otolith to slide over the macula in the direction of gravity. The moving otolith layer, in turn, bends the sterocilia to cause
some hair cells to depolarize as others hyperpolarize. The exact tilt of the head is interpreted by the brain on the basis of the
pattern of hair-cell depolarization.

Figure 14.11 Linear Acceleration Coding by Maculae The maculae are specialized for sensing linear acceleration,
such as when gravity acts on the tilting head, or if the head starts moving in a straight line. The difference in inertia
between the hair cell stereocilia and the otolith in which they are embedded leads to a shearing force that causes the
stereocilia to bend in the direction of that linear acceleration.

The semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas
the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The anterior and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately
45 degrees relative to the sagittal plane (Figure 14.12). The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the
vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the ampulla. The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to
rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying “no.” The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the cupula,
a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the
fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The semicircular canals contain several
ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically. By comparing the relative movements of both
the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect the direction of most head movements within three-
dimensional (3-D) space.

Ampullary nerve Y cupula bends in opposite
direction of the rotation

Figure 14.12 Rotational Coding by Semicircular Canals Rotational movement of the head is encoded by the hair
cells in the base of the semicircular canals. As one of the canals moves in an arc with the head, the internal fluid moves
in the opposite direction, causing the cupula and stereocilia to bend. The movement of two canals within a plane results
in information about the direction in which the head is moving, and activation of all six canals can give a very precise
indication of head movement in three dimensions.

Somatosensation (Touch)

Somatosensation is considered a general sense, as opposed to the special senses discussed in this section. Somatosensation is
the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch, proprioception, and interoception. These modalities include

573

574 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES

pressure, vibration, light touch, tickle, itch, temperature, pain, proprioception, and kinesthesia. This means that its receptors
are not associated with a specialized organ, but are instead spread throughout the body in a variety of organs. Many of the
somatosensory receptors are located in the skin, but receptors are also found in muscles, tendons, joint capsules, ligaments,
and in the walls of visceral organs.

Two types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by free nerve endings are pain and temperature. These
two modalities use thermoreceptors and nociceptors to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively. Temperature
receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from body temperature. Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just
cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal
stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations. Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate
receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves capsaicin, the
active molecule in hot peppers. Capsaicin molecules bind to a transmembrane ion channel in nociceptors that is sensitive
to temperatures above 37°C. The dynamics of capsaicin binding with this transmembrane ion channel is unusual in that the
molecule remains bound for a long time. Because of this, it will decrease the ability of other stimuli to elicit pain sensations
through the activated nociceptor. For this reason, capsaicin can be used as a topical analgesic, such as in products such as
Icy Hot™.

If you drag your finger across a textured surface, the skin of your finger will vibrate. Such low frequency vibrations are
sensed by mechanoreceptors called Merkel cells, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel cells are located
in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated (Pacinian) corpuscles, which
are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Light touch is transduced by the
encapsulated endings known as tactile (Meissner) corpuscles. Follicles are also wrapped in a plexus of nerve endings known
as the hair follicle plexus. These nerve endings detect the movement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an
insect may be walking along the skin. Stretching of the skin is transduced by stretch receptors known as bulbous corpuscles.
Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.

Other somatosensory receptors are found in the joints and muscles. Stretch receptors monitor the stretching of tendons,
muscles, and the components of joints. For example, have you ever stretched your muscles before or after exercise and
noticed that you can only stretch so far before your muscles spasm back to a less stretched state? This spasm is a reflex
that is initiated by stretch receptors to avoid muscle tearing. Such stretch receptors can also prevent over-contraction
of a muscle. In skeletal muscle tissue, these stretch receptors are called muscle spindles. Golgi tendon organs similarly
transduce the stretch levels of tendons. Bulbous corpuscles are also present in joint capsules, where they measure stretch
in the components of the skeletal system within the joint. The types of nerve endings, their locations, and the stimuli they
transduce are presented in Table 14.1.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 575

Vision

Vision is the special sense of sight that is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes. The eyes are
located within either orbit in the skull. The bony orbits surround the eyeballs, protecting them and anchoring the soft tissues
of the eye (Figure 14.13). The eyelids, with lashes at their leading edges, help to protect the eye from abrasions by blocking
particles that may land on the surface of the eye. The inner surface of each lid is a thin membrane known as the palpebral
conjunctiva. The conjunctiva extends over the white areas of the eye (the sclera), connecting the eyelids to the eyeball.
Tears are produced by the lacrimal gland, located beneath the lateral edges of the nose. Tears produced by this gland flow
through the lacrimal duct to the medial corner of the eye, where the tears flow over the conjunctiva, washing away foreign
particles.

Figure 14.13 The Eye in the Orbit The eye is located within the orbit and surrounded by soft tissues that protect and
support its function. The orbit is surrounded by cranial bones of the skull.

Movement of the eye within the orbit is accomplished by the contraction of six extraocular muscles that originate
from the bones of the orbit and insert into the surface of the eyeball (Figure 14.14). Four of the muscles are arranged at
the cardinal points around the eye and are named for those locations. They are the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior
rectus, and lateral rectus. When each of these muscles contract, the eye to moves toward the contracting muscle. For
example, when the superior rectus contracts, the eye rotates to look up. The superior oblique originates at the posterior
orbit, near the origin of the four rectus muscles. However, the tendon of the oblique muscles threads through a pulley-like
piece of cartilage known as the trochlea. The tendon inserts obliquely into the superior surface of the eye. The angle of the
tendon through the trochlea means that contraction of the superior oblique rotates the eye medially. The inferior oblique
muscle originates from the floor of the orbit and inserts into the inferolateral surface of the eye. When it contracts, it laterally
rotates the eye, in opposition to the superior oblique. Rotation of the eye by the two oblique muscles is necessary because
the eye is not perfectly aligned on the sagittal plane. When the eye looks up or down, the eye must also rotate slightly to
compensate for the superior rectus pulling at approximately a 20-degree angle, rather than straight up. The same is true for
the inferior rectus, which is compensated by contraction of the inferior oblique. A seventh muscle in the orbit is the levator
palpebrae superioris, which is responsible for elevating and retracting the upper eyelid, a movement that usually occurs in
concert with elevation of the eye by the superior rectus (see Figure 14.13).

The extraocular muscles are innervated by three cranial nerves. The lateral rectus, which causes abduction of the eye,
is innervated by the abducens nerve. The superior oblique is innervated by the trochlear nerve. All of the other muscles are
innervated by the oculomotor nerve, as is the levator palpebrae superioris. The motor nuclei of these cranial nerves connect
to the brain stem, which coordinates eye movements.

The eye is also divided into two cavities: the anterior cavity and the posterior cavity. The anterior cavity is the space

led the aqueous humor.

The posterior cavity is the space behind the lens that extends to the posterior side of the interior eyeball, where the retina is

located. The posterior cavity is filled with a more viscous fluid called the vitreous humor.
The retina is composed of several layers and contains specialized cells for the initial processi

ng of visual stimuli. The

photoreceptors (rods and cones) change their membrane potential when stimulated by light energy. The change in membrane
potential alters the amount of neurotransmitter that the photoreceptor cells release onto bipolar cells in the outer synaptic
layer. It is the bipolar cell in the retina that connects a photoreceptor to a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) in the inner synaptic

layer. There, amacrine cells additionally contribute to retinal processing before an action potential

is produced by the RGC.

The axons of RGCs, which lie at the innermost layer of the retina, collect at the optic disc and leave the eye as the optic
nerve (see Figure 14.15). Because these axons pass through the retina, there are no photoreceptors at the very back of the
eye, where the optic nerve begins. This creates a “blind spot” in the retina, and a corresponding blind spot in our visual

field.

Figure 14.15 Structure of the Eye The sphere of the eye can be divided into anterior and posterior chambers. The
wall of the eye is composed of three layers: the fibrous tunic, vascular tunic, and neural tunic. Within the neural tunic is
the retina, with three layers of cells and two synaptic layers in between. The center of the retina has a small indentation
known as the fovea.

Note that the photoreceptors in the retina (rods and cones) are located behind the axons, RGCs, bipolar cells, and retinal
blood vessels. A significant amount of light is absorbed by these structures before the light reaches the photoreceptor cells.
However, at the exact center of the retina is a small area known as the fovea. At the fovea, the retina lacks the supporting
cells and blood vessels, and only contains photoreceptors. Therefore, visual acuity, or the sharpness of vision, is greatest at
the fovea. This is because the fovea is where the least amount of incoming light is absorbed by other retinal structures (see
Figure 14.15). As one moves in either direction from this central point of the retina, visual acuity drops significantly. In
addition, each photoreceptor cell of the fovea is connected to a single RGC. Therefore, this RGC does not have to integrate
inputs from multiple photoreceptors, which reduces the accuracy of visual transduction. Toward the edges of the retina,
several photoreceptors converge on RGCs (through the bipolar cells) up to a ratio of 50 to 1. The difference in visual acuity
between the fovea and peripheral retina is easily evidenced by looking directly at a word in the middle of this paragraph.
The visual stimulus in the middle of the field of view falls on the fovea and is in the sharpest focus. Without moving your
eyes off that word, notice that words at the beginning or end of the paragraph are not in focus. The images in your peripheral
vision are focused by the peripheral retina, and have vague, blurry edges and words that are not as clearly identified. As a
result, a large part of the neural function of the eyes is concerned with moving the eyes and head so that important visual
stimuli are centered on the fovea.

Light falling on the retina causes chemical changes to pigment molecules in the photoreceptors, ultimately leading
to a change in the activity of the RGCs. Photoreceptor cells have two parts, the inner segment and the outer segment
(Figure 14.16). The inner segment contains the nucleus and other common organelles of a cell, whereas the outer segment
is a specialized region in which photoreception takes place. There are two types of photoreceptors—rods and cones—which
differ in the shape of their outer segment. The rod-shaped outer segments of the rod photoreceptor contain a stack
of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin. The cone-shaped outer segments of the
cone photoreceptor contain their photosensitive pigments in infoldings of the cell membrane. There are three cone
photopigments, called opsins, which are each sensitive to a particular wavelength of light. The wavelength of visible light

determines its color. The pigments in human eyes are specialized in perceiving three different primary colors: red, green,
and blue.

At the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane
potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a photon, which is described in physics as a packet of
energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The energy of a photon is represented by its wavelength, with each
wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular color. Visible light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength
between 380 and 720 nm. Longer wavelengths of less than 380 nm fall into the infrared range, whereas shorter wavelengths
of more than 720 nm fall into the ultraviolet range. Light with a wavelength of 380 nm is blue whereas light with a
wavelength of 720 nm is dark red. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.

Opsin pigments are actually transmembrane proteins that contain a cofactor known as retinal. Retinal is a hydrocarbon
molecule related to vitamin A. When a photon hits retinal, the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule is biochemically
altered. Specifically, photons cause some of the double-bonded carbons within the chain to switch from a cis to a trans

conformation. This process is called photoisomerization. Before interacting with a photon, retinal’s flexible double-bonded
carbons are in the cis conformation. This molecule is referred to as 11-cis-retinal. A photon interacting with the molecule
causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans- conformation, forming all-trans-retinal, which has a
straight hydrocarbon chain (Figure 14.17).

The shape change of retinal in the photoreceptors initiates visual transduction in the retina. Activation of retinal and the
opsin proteins result in activation of a G protein. The G protein changes the membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell,
which then releases less neurotransmitter into the outer synaptic layer of the retina. Until the retinal molecule is changed
back to the 11-cis-retinal shape, the opsin cannot respond to light energy, which is called bleaching. When a large group
of photopigments is bleached, the retina will send information as if opposing visual information is being perceived. After a
bright flash of light, afterimages are usually seen in negative. The photoisomerization is reversed by a series of enzymatic
changes so that the retinal responds to more light energy.

The opsins are sensitive to limited wavelengths of light. Rhodopsin, the photopigment in rods, is most sensitive to light
at a wavelength of 498 nm. The three color opsins have peak sensitivities of 564 nm, 534 nm, and 420 nm corresponding
roughly to the primary colors of red, green, and blue (Figure 14.18). The absorbance of rhodopsin in the rods is much more
sensitive than in the cone opsins; specifically, rods are sensitive to vision in low light conditions, and cones are sensitive
to brighter conditions. In normal sunlight, rhodopsin will be constantly bleached while the cones are active. In a darkened
room, there is not enough light to activate cone opsins, and vision is entirely dependent on rods. Rods are so sensitive to
light that a single photon can result in an action potential from a rod’s corresponding RGC.

The three types of cone opsins, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision. By
comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can extract color information from visual stimuli. For example,
a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450 nm would activate the “red” cones minimally, the “green”
cones marginally, and the “blue” cones predominantly. The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by
the brain, which perceives the color as blue. However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the
color of light. Therefore, our low-light vision is—in essence—in grayscale. In other words, in a dark room, everything
appears as a shade of gray. If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what
color something is and is relying on that memory.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/occipital) to learn more about a transverse section through the brain
that depicts the visual pathway from the eye to the occipital cortex. The first half of the pathway is the projection from
the RGCs through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus on either side. This first fiber in
the pathway synapses on a thalamic cell that then projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe where “seeing,” or
visual perception, takes place. This video gives an abbreviated overview of the visual system by concentrating on the
pathway from the eyes to the occipital lobe. The video makes the statement (at 0:45) that “specialized cells in the retina
called ganglion cells convert the light rays into electrical signals.” What aspect of retinal processing is simplified by
that statement? Explain your answer.

Sensory Nerves

Once any sensory cell transduces a stimulus into a nerve impulse, that impulse has to travel along axons to reach the CNS.
In many of the special senses, the axons leaving the sensory receptors have a topographical arrangement, meaning that
the location of the sensory receptor relates to the location of the axon in the nerve. For example, in the retina, axons from
RGCs in the fovea are located at the center of the optic nerve, where they are surrounded by axons from the more peripheral
RGCs.

Spinal Nerves

Generally, spinal nerves contain afferent axons from sensory receptors in the periphery, such as from the skin, mixed with
efferent axons travelling to the muscles or other effector organs. As the spinal nerve nears the spinal cord, it splits into
dorsal and ventral roots. The dorsal root contains only the axons of sensory neurons, whereas the ventral roots contain only
the axons of the motor neurons. Some of the branches will synapse with local neurons in the dorsal root ganglion, posterior
(dorsal) horn, or even the anterior (ventral) horn, at the level of the spinal cord where they enter. Other branches will travel
a short distance up or down the spine to interact with neurons at other levels of the spinal cord. A branch may also turn into
the posterior (dorsal) column of the white matter to connect with the brain. For the sake of convenience, we will use the
terms ventral and dorsal in reference to structures within the spinal cord that are part of these pathways. This will help to

underscore the relationships between the different components. Typically, spinal nerve systems that connect to the brain are
contralateral, in that the right side of the body is connected to the left side of the brain and the left side of the body to the
right side of the brain.

Cranial Nerves

Cranial nerves convey specific sensory information from the head and neck directly to the brain. For sensations below the
neck, the right side of the body is connected to the left side of the brain and the left side of the body to the right side of the
brain. Whereas spinal information is contralateral, cranial nerve systems are mostly ipsilateral, meaning that a cranial nerve
on the right side of the head is connected to the right side of the brain. Some cranial nerves contain only sensory axons, such
as the olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves. Other cranial nerves contain both sensory and motor axons, including
the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves (however, the vagus nerve is not associated with the somatic
nervous system). The general senses of somatosensation for the face travel through the trigeminal system.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the pathways that sensory systems follow into the central nervous system
¢ Differentiate between the two major ascending pathways in the spinal cord

* Describe the pathway of somatosensory input from the face and compare it to the ascending pathways in the spinal
cord

¢ Explain topographical representations of sensory information in at least two systems

¢ Describe two pathways of visual processing and the functions associated with each

Sensory Pathways

Specific regions of the CNS coordinate different somatic processes using sensory inputs and motor outputs of peripheral
nerves. A simple case is a reflex caused by a synapse between a dorsal sensory neuron axon and a motor neuron in the
ventral horn. More complex arrangements are possible to integrate peripheral sensory information with higher processes.
The important regions of the CNS that play a role in somatic processes can be separated into the spinal cord brain stem,
diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures.

Spinal Cord and Brain Stem

A sensory pathway that carries peripheral sensations to the brain is referred to as an ascending pathway, or ascending
tract. The various sensory modalities each follow specific pathways through the CNS. Tactile and other somatosensory
stimuli activate receptors in the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints throughout the entire body. However, the somatosensory
pathways are divided into two separate systems on the basis of the location of the receptor neurons. Somatosensory stimuli
from below the neck pass along the sensory pathways of the spinal cord, whereas somatosensory stimuli from the head and
neck travel through the cranial nerves—specifically, the trigeminal system.
The dorsal column system (sometimes referred to as the dorsal column—medial lemniscus) and the spinothalamic
tract are two major pathways that bring sensory information to the brain (Figure 14.19). The sensory pathways in each o
these systems are composed of three successive neurons.
The dorsal column system begins with the axon of a dorsal root ganglion neuron entering the dorsal root and joining the
dorsal column white matter in the spinal cord. As axons of this pathway enter the dorsal column, they take on a positional
arrangement so that axons from lower levels of the body position themselves medially, whereas axons from upper levels o
the body position themselves laterally. The dorsal column is separated into two component tracts, the fasciculus gracilis
that contains axons from the legs and lower body, and the fasciculus cuneatus that contains axons from the upper body and
arms.

The axons in the dorsal column terminate in the nuclei of the medulla, where each synapses with the second neuron in
their respective pathway. The nucleus gracilis is the target of fibers in the fasciculus gracilis, whereas the nucleus cuneatus
is the target of fibers in the fasciculus cuneatus. The second neuron in the system projects from one of the two nuclei and
then decussates, or crosses the midline of the medulla. These axons then continue to ascend the brain stem as a bundle
called the medial lemniscus. These axons terminate in the thalamus, where each synapses with the third neuron in their
respective pathway. The third neuron in the system projects its axons to the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex, where
somatosensory stimuli are initially processed and the conscious perception of the stimulus occurs.

The spinothalamic tract also begins with neurons in a dorsal root ganglion. These neurons extend their axons to the
dorsal horn, where they synapse with the second neuron in their respective pathway. The name “spinothalamic” comes from
this second neuron, which has its cell body in the spinal cord gray matter and connects to the thalamus. Axons from these
second neurons then decussate within the spinal cord and ascend to the brain and enter the thalamus, where each synapses
with the third neuron in its respective pathway. The neurons in the thalamus then project their axons to the spinothalamic
tract, which synapses in the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex.


582 CHAPTER 14| THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES

These two systems are similar in that they both begin with dorsal root ganglion cells, as with most general sensory
information. The dorsal column system is primarily responsible for touch sensations and proprioception, whereas the
spinothalamic tract pathway is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensations. Another similarity is that the
second neurons in both of these pathways are contralateral, because they project across the midline to the other side of
the brain or spinal cord. In the dorsal column system, this decussation takes place in the brain stem; in the spinothalamic
pathway, it takes place in the spinal cord at the same spinal cord level at which the information entered. The third neurons
in the two pathways are essentially the same. In both, the second neuron synapses in the thalamus, and the thalamic neuron
projects to the somatosensory cortex.

Figure 14.19 Ascending Sensory Pathways of the Spinal Cord The dorsal column system and spinothalamic tract
are the major ascending pathways that connect the periphery with the brain.

The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity. As with the
previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons.
First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. These axons project to one of
three locations. The spinal trigeminal nucleus of the medulla receives information similar to that carried by spinothalamic
tract, such as pain and temperature sensations. Other axons go to either the chief sensory nucleus in the pons or the
mesencephalic nuclei in the midbrain. These nuclei receive information like that carried by the dorsal column system, such
as touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception. Axons from the second neuron decussate and ascend to the thalamus along
the trigeminothalamic tract. In the thalamus, each axon synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway. Axons
from the third neuron then project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum.

The sensory pathway for gustation travels along the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, which synapse with
neurons of the solitary nucleus in the brain stem. Axons from the solitary nucleus then project to the ventral posterior
nucleus of the thalamus. Finally, axons from the ventral posterior nucleus project to the gustatory cortex of the cerebral
cortex, where taste is processed and consciously perceived.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 583

The sensory pathway for audition travels along the vestibulocochlear nerve, which synapses with neurons in the
cochlear nuclei of the superior medulla. Within the brain stem, input from either ear is combined to extract location
information from the auditory stimuli. Whereas the initial auditory stimuli received at the cochlea strictly represent the
frequency—or pitch—of the stimuli, the locations of sounds can be determined by comparing information arriving at both
ears.

Sound localization is a feature of central processing in the auditory nuclei of the brain stem. Sound localization
is achieved by the brain calculating the interaural time difference and the interaural intensity difference. A sound
originating from a specific location will arrive at each ear at different times, unless the sound is directly in front of the
listener. If the sound source is slightly to the left of the listener, the sound will arrive at the left ear microseconds before it
arrives at the right ear (Figure 14.20). This time difference is an example of an interaural time difference. Also, the sound
will be slightly louder in the left ear than in the right ear because some of the sound waves reaching the opposite ear are
blocked by the head. This is an example of an interaural intensity difference.

achieved by processing in the medullary nuclei of the auditory system. Connections between neurons on either side
are able to compare very slight differences in sound stimuli that arrive at either ear and represent interaural time and
intensity differences.

Auditory processing continues on to a nucleus in the midbrain called the inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior
colliculus project to two locations, the thalamus and the superior colliculus. The medial geniculate nucleus of the
thalamus receives the auditory information and then projects that information to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of
the cerebral cortex. The superior colliculus receives input from the visual and somatosensory systems, as well as the ears,
to initiate stimulation of the muscles that turn the head and neck toward the auditory stimulus.

Balance is coordinated through the vestibular system, the nerves of which are composed of axons from the vestibular
ganglion that carries information from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals. The system contributes to controlling
head and neck movements in response to vestibular signals. An important function of the vestibular system is coordinating
eye and head movements to maintain visual attention. Most of the axons terminate in the vestibular nuclei of the medulla.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 585

Some axons project from the vestibular ganglion directly to the cerebellum, with no intervening synapse in the vestibular
nuclei. The cerebellum is primarily responsible for initiating movements on the basis of equilibrium information.

Neurons in the vestibular nuclei project their axons to targets in the brain stem. One target is the reticular formation,
which influences respiratory and cardiovascular functions in relation to body movements. A second target of the axons of
neurons in the vestibular nuclei is the spinal cord, which initiates the spinal reflexes involved with posture and balance.
To assist the visual system, fibers of the vestibular nuclei project to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei to
influence signals sent along the cranial nerves. These connections constitute the pathway of the vestibulo-ocular reflex
(VOR), which compensates for head and body movement by stabilizing images on the retina (Figure 14.21). Finally, the
vestibular nuclei project to the thalamus to join the proprioceptive pathway of the dorsal column system, allowing conscious
perception of equilibrium.

Figure 14.21 Vestibulo-ocular Reflex Connections between the vestibular system and the cranial nerves controlling
eye movement keep the eyes centered on a visual stimulus, even though the head is moving. During head movement,
the eye muscles move the eyes in the opposite direction as the head movement, keeping the visual stimulus centered
in the field of view.

The connections of the optic nerve are more complicated than those of other cranial nerves. Instead of the connections
being between each eye and the brain, visual information is segregated between the left and right sides of the visual field.
In addition, some of the information from one side of the visual field projects to the opposite side of the brain. Within each
eye, the axons projecting from the medial side of the retina decussate at the optic chiasm. For example, the axons from the
medial retina of the left eye cross over to the right side of the brain at the optic chiasm. However, within each eye, the axons
projecting from the lateral side of the retina do not decussate. For example, the axons from the lateral retina of the right eye
project back to the right side of the brain. Therefore the left field of view of each eye is processed on the right side of the
brain, whereas the right field of view of each eye is processed on the left side of the brain (Figure 14.22).

Figure 14.22 Segregation of Visual Field Information at the Optic Chiasm Contralateral visual field information
from the lateral retina projects to the ipsilateral brain, whereas ipsilateral visual field information has to decussate at
the optic chiasm to reach the opposite side of the brain.

A unique clinical presentation that relates to this anatomic arrangement is the loss of lateral peripheral vision, known
as bilateral hemianopia. This is different from “tunnel vision” because the superior and inferior peripheral fields are not
lost. Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the visual system itself. A
growth of the pituitary gland presses against the optic chiasm and interferes with signal transmission. However, the axons
projecting to the same side of the brain are unaffected. Therefore, the patient loses the outermost areas of their field of vision
and cannot see objects to their right and left.

Extending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic
nerve. The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain. The connection between
the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina differentiates from
that of the diencephalon by the growth of the secondary vesicles. The connections of the retina into the CNS are a holdover
from this developmental association. The majority of the connections of the optic tract are to the thalamus—specifically,
the lateral geniculate nucleus. Axons from this nucleus then project to the visual cortex of the cerebrum, located in the
occipital lobe. Another target of the optic tract is the superior colliculus.

In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of
the hypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the
photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to the
absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length. The perceived proportion of sunlight to
darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur at approximately
the same time every day.

Diencephalon

The diencephalon is beneath the cerebrum and includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the somatic nervous system,
the thalamus is an important relay for communication between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system. The
hypothalamus has both somatic and autonomic functions. In addition, the hypothalamus communicates with the limbic
system, which controls emotions and memory functions.

Sensory input to the thalamus comes from most of the special senses and ascending somatosensory tracts. Each sensory
system is relayed through a particular nucleus in the thalamus. The thalamus is a required transfer point for most sensory
tracts that reach the cerebral cortex, where conscious sensory perception begins. The one exception to this rule is the
olfactory system. The olfactory tract axons from the olfactory bulb project directly to the cerebral cortex, along with the
limbic system and hypothalamus.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 587

The thalamus is a collection of several nuclei that can be categorized into three anatomical groups. White matter
running through the thalamus defines the three major regions of the thalamus, which are an anterior nucleus, a medial
nucleus, and a lateral group of nuclei. The anterior nucleus serves as a relay between the hypothalamus and the emotion
and memory-producing limbic system. The medial nuclei serve as a relay for information from the limbic system and basal
ganglia to the cerebral cortex. This allows memory creation during learning, but also determines alertness. The special and
somatic senses connect to the lateral nuclei, where their information is relayed to the appropriate sensory cortex of the
cerebrum.

Cortical Processing

As described earlier, many of the sensory axons are positioned in the same way as their corresponding receptor cells in the
body. This allows identification of the position of a stimulus on the basis of which receptor cells are sending information.
The cerebral cortex also maintains this sensory topography in the particular areas of the cortex that correspond to the
position of the receptor cells. The somatosensory cortex provides an example in which, in essence, the locations of the
somatosensory receptors in the body are mapped onto the somatosensory cortex. This mapping is often depicted using a
sensory homunculus (Figure 14.23).

The term homunculus comes from the Latin word for “little man” and refers to a map of the human body that is
laid across a portion of the cerebral cortex. In the somatosensory cortex, the external genitals, feet, and lower legs are
represented on the medial face of the gyrus within the longitudinal fissure. As the gyrus curves out of the fissure and
along the surface of the parietal lobe, the body map continues through the thighs, hips, trunk, shoulders, arms, and hands.
The head and face are just lateral to the fingers as the gyrus approaches the lateral sulcus. The representation of the body
in this topographical map is medial to lateral from the lower to upper body. It is a continuation of the topographical
arrangement seen in the dorsal column system, where axons from the lower body are carried in the fasciculus gracilis,
whereas axons from the upper body are carried in the fasciculus cuneatus. As the dorsal column system continues into the
medial lemniscus, these relationships are maintained. Also, the head and neck axons running from the trigeminal nuclei to
the thalamus run adjacent to the upper body fibers. The connections through the thalamus maintain topography such that
the anatomic information is preserved. Note that this correspondence does not result in a perfectly miniature scale version
of the body, but rather exaggerates the more sensitive areas of the body, such as the fingers and lower face. Less sensitive
areas of the body, such as the shoulders and back, are mapped to smaller areas on the cortex.

Likewise, the topographic relationship between the retina and the visual cortex is maintained throughout the visual
pathway. The visual field is projected onto the two retinae, as described above, with sorting at the optic chiasm. The right
peripheral visual field falls on the medial portion of the right retina and the lateral portion of the left retina. The right medial
retina then projects across the midline through the optic chiasm. This results in the right visual field being processed in the
left visual cortex. Likewise, the left visual field is processed in the right visual cortex (see Figure 14.22). Though the chiasm

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 589

The cortex has been described as having specific regions that are responsible for processing specific information;
there is the visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, gustatory cortex, etc. However, our experience of these senses is not
divided. Instead, we experience what can be referred to as a seamless percept. Our perceptions of the various sensory
modalities—though distinct in their content—are integrated by the brain so that we experience the world as a continuous
whole.

In the cerebral cortex, sensory processing begins at the primary sensory cortex, then proceeds to an association area,
and finally, into a multimodal integration area. For example, the visual pathway projects from the retinae through the
thalamus to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. This area is primarily in the medial wall within the longitudinal
fissure. Here, visual stimuli begin to be recognized as basic shapes. Edges of objects are recognized and built into more
complex shapes. Also, inputs from both eyes are compared to extract depth information. Because of the overlapping field
of view between the two eyes, the brain can begin to estimate the distance of stimuli based on binocular depth cues.

Similar to how retinal disparity offers 3-D moviegoers a way to extract 3-D information from the two-dimensional
visual field projected onto the retina, the brain can extract information about movement in space by comparing what
the two eyes see. If movement of a visual stimulus is leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the brain
interprets this as movement toward (or away) from the face along the midline. If both eyes see an object moving in the
same direction, but at different rates, what would that mean for spatial movement?

590 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES

Everyday CONNECTION

Depth Perception, 3-D Movies, and Optical Illusions

The visual field is projected onto the retinal surface, where photoreceptors transduce light energy into neural signals
for the brain to interpret. The retina is a two-dimensional surface, so it does not encode three-dimensional information.
However, we can perceive depth. How is that accomplished?

Two ways in which we can extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal signal are based on
monocular cues and binocular cues, respectively. Monocular depth cues are those that are the result of information
within the two-dimensional visual field. One object that overlaps another object has to be in front. Relative size
differences are also a cue. For example, if a basketball appears larger than the basket, then the basket must be
further away. On the basis of experience, we can estimate how far away the basket is. Binocular depth cues compare
information represented in the two retinae because they do not see the visual field exactly the same.

The centers of the two eyes are separated by a small distance, which is approximately 6 to 6.5 cm in most people.
Because of this offset, visual stimuli do not fall on exactly the same spot on both retinae unless we are fixated directly
on them and they fall on the fovea of each retina. All other objects in the visual field, either closer or farther away than
the fixated object, will fall on different spots on the retina. When vision is fixed on an object in space, closer objects
will fall on the lateral retina of each eye, and more distant objects will fall on the medial retina of either eye (Figure
14.25). This is easily observed by holding a finger up in front of your face as you look at a more distant object. You
will see two images of your finger that represent the two disparate images that are falling on either retina.

These depth cues, both monocular and binocular, can be exploited to make the brain think there are three
dimensions in two-dimensional information. This is the basis of 3-D movies. The projected image on the screen is two
dimensional, but it has disparate information embedded in it. The 3-D glasses that are available at the theater filter the
information so that only one eye sees one version of what is on the screen, and the other eye sees the other version. If
you take the glasses off, the image on the screen will have varying amounts of blur because both eyes are seeing both
layers of information, and the third dimension will not be evident. Some optical illusions can take advantage of depth
cues as well, though those are more often using monocular cues to fool the brain into seeing different parts of the scene
as being at different depths.

Figure 14.25 Retinal Disparity Because of the interocular distance, which results in objects of different distances
falling on different spots of the two retinae, the brain can extract depth perception from the two-dimensional
information of the visual field.

There are two main regions that surround the primary cortex that are usually referred to as areas V2 and V3 (the
primary visual cortex is area V1). These surrounding areas are the visual association cortex. The visual association regions
develop more complex visual perceptions by adding color and motion information. The information processed in these areas
is then sent to regions of the temporal and parietal lobes. Visual processing has two separate streams of processing: one into
the temporal lobe and one into the parietal lobe. These are the ventral and dorsal streams, respectively (Figure 14.26). The
ventral stream identifies visual stimuli and their significance. Because the ventral stream uses temporal lobe structures, it
begins to interact with the non-visual cortex and may be important in visual stimuli becoming part of memories. The dorsal
stream locates objects in space and helps in guiding movements of the body in response to visual inputs. The dorsal stream
enters the parietal lobe, where it interacts with somatosensory cortical areas that are important for our perception of the
body and its movements. The dorsal stream can then influence frontal lobe activity where motor functions originate.

Brain: Prosopagnosia

The failures of sensory perception can be unusual and debilitating. A particular sensory deficit that inhibits an
important social function of humans is prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The word comes from the Greek words
prosopa, that means “faces,” and agnosia, that means “not knowing.” Some people may feel that they cannot recognize
people easily by their faces. However, a person with prosopagnosia cannot recognize the most recognizable people in
their respective cultures. They would not recognize the face of a celebrity, an important historical figure, or even a
family member like their mother. They may not even recognize their own face.

Prosopagnosia can be caused by trauma to the brain, or it can be present from birth. The exact cause of
proposagnosia and the reason that it happens to some people is unclear. A study of the brains of people born
with the deficit found that a specific region of the brain, the anterior fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe, is often
underdeveloped. This region of the brain is concerned with the recognition of visual stimuli and its possible association
with memories. Though the evidence is not yet definitive, this region is likely to be where facial recognition occurs.

Though this can be a devastating condition, people who suffer from it can get by—often by using other cues to
recognize the people they see. Often, the sound of a person’s voice, or the presence of unique cues such as distinct
facial features (a mole, for example) or hair color can help the sufferer recognize a familiar person. In the video on
prosopagnosia provided in this section, a woman is shown having trouble recognizing celebrities, family members, and
herself. In some situations, she can use other cues to help her recognize faces.

The inability to recognize people by their faces is a troublesome problem. It can be caused by trauma, or it may be

recognize faces as the result of an injury. She cannot recognize the faces of close family members or herself. What
other information can a person suffering from prosopagnosia use to figure out whom they are seeing?

14.3 | Motor Responses

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ List the components of the basic processing stream for the motor system
* Describe the pathway of descending motor commands from the cortex to the skeletal muscles
* Compare different descending pathways, both by structure and function
¢ Explain the initiation of movement from the neurological connections

¢ Describe several reflex arcs and their functional roles

The defining characteristic of the somatic nervous system is that it controls skeletal muscles. Somatic senses inform the
nervous system about the external environment, but the response to that is through voluntary muscle movement. The term
“voluntary” suggests that there is a conscious decision to make a movement. However, some aspects of the somatic system
use voluntary muscles without conscious control. One example is the ability of our breathing to switch to unconscious
control while we are focused on another task. However, the muscles that are responsible for the basic process of breathing
are also utilized for speech, which is entirely voluntary.

Cortical Responses

Let’s start with sensory stimuli that have been registered through receptor cells and the information relayed to the CNS along
ascending pathways. In the cerebral cortex, the initial processing of sensory perception progresses to associative processing
and then integration in multimodal areas of cortex. These levels of processing can lead to the incorporation of sensory
perceptions into memory, but more importantly, they lead to a response. The completion of cortical processing through the
primary, associative, and integrative sensory areas initiates a similar progression of motor processing, usually in different
cortical areas.

Whereas the sensory cortical areas are located in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, motor functions are
largely controlled by the frontal lobe. The most anterior regions of the frontal lobe—the prefrontal areas—are important
for executive functions, which are those cognitive functions that lead to goal-directed behaviors. These higher cognitive
processes include working memory, which has been called a “mental scratch pad,” that can help organize and represent
information that is not in the immediate environment. The prefrontal lobe is responsible for aspects of attention, such as
inhibiting distracting thoughts and actions so that a person can focus on a goal and direct behavior toward achieving that
goal.

The functions of the prefrontal cortex are integral to the personality of an individual, because it is largely responsible
for what a person intends to do and how they accomplish those plans. A famous case of damage to the prefrontal cortex
is that of Phineas Gage, dating back to 1848. He was a railroad worker who had a metal spike impale his prefrontal
cortex (Figure 14.27). He survived the accident, but according to second-hand accounts, his personality changed drastically.
Friends described him as no longer acting like himself. Whereas he was a hardworking, amiable man before the accident,
he turned into an irritable, temperamental, and lazy man after the accident. Many of the accounts of his change may have
been inflated in the retelling, and some behavior was likely attributable to alcohol used as a pain medication. However, the
accounts suggest that some aspects of his personality did change. Also, there is new evidence that though his life changed
dramatically, he was able to become a functioning stagecoach driver, suggesting that the brain has the ability to recover
even from major trauma such as this.

Secondary Motor Cortices

In generating motor responses, the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex will need to initiate actual movements. One
way to define the prefrontal area is any region of the frontal lobe that does not elicit movement when electrically stimulated.
These are primarily in the anterior part of the frontal lobe. The regions of the frontal lobe that remain are the regions of the
cortex that produce movement. The prefrontal areas project into the secondary motor cortices, which include the premotor
cortex and the supplemental motor area.

Two important regions that assist in planning and coordinating movements are located adjacent to the primary motor
cortex. The premotor cortex is more lateral, whereas the supplemental motor area is more medial and superior. The premotor
area aids in controlling movements of the core muscles to maintain posture during movement, whereas the supplemental
motor area is hypothesized to be responsible for planning and coordinating movement. The supplemental motor area also
manages sequential movements that are based on prior experience (that is, learned movements). Neurons in these areas are
most active leading up to the initiation of movement. For example, these areas might prepare the body for the movements
necessary to drive a car in anticipation of a traffic light changing.

Adjacent to these two regions are two specialized motor planning centers. The frontal eye fields are responsible for
moving the eyes in response to visual stimuli. There are direct connections between the frontal eye fields and the superior
colliculus. Also, anterior to the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex is Broca’s area. This area is responsible for
controlling movements of the structures of speech production. The area is named after a French surgeon and anatomist who
studied patients who could not produce speech. They did not have impairments to understanding speech, only to producing
speech sounds, suggesting a damaged or underdeveloped Broca’s area.

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 595

Primary Motor Cortex

The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. A neurosurgeon, Walter Penfield, described
much of the basic understanding of the primary motor cortex by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebrum.
Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that he could observe
responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated muscle movement. We now
know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in planning movement, and its principle output
stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle contraction.

The primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a
topographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for musculature
in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and shoulder at the crest
of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the relative space allotted for the
different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest amount of cortical space is given to
muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers and the lower face. The “power muscles”
that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.

Descending Pathways

The motor output from the cortex descends into the brain stem and to the spinal cord to control the musculature through
motor neurons. Neurons located in the primary motor cortex, named Betz cells, are large cortical neurons that synapse with
lower motor neurons in the spinal cord or the brain stem. The two descending pathways travelled by the axons of Betz
cells are the corticospinal tract and the corticobulbar tract. Both tracts are named for their origin in the cortex and their
targets—either the spinal cord or the brain stem (the term “bulbar” refers to the brain stem as the bulb, or enlargement, at
the top of the spinal cord).

These two descending pathways are responsible for the conscious or voluntary movements of skeletal muscles. Any
motor command from the primary motor cortex is sent down the axons of the Betz cells to activate upper motor neurons in
either the cranial motor nuclei or in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The axons of the corticobulbar tract are ipsilateral,
meaning they project from the cortex to the motor nucleus on the same side of the nervous system. Conversely, the axons
of the corticospinal tract are largely contralateral, meaning that they cross the midline of the brain stem or spinal cord and
synapse on the opposite side of the body. Therefore, the right motor cortex of the cerebrum controls muscles on the left side
of the body, and vice versa.

The corticospinal tract descends from the cortex through the deep white matter of the cerebrum. It then passes between
the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal nuclei as a bundle called the internal capsule. The tract then passes through
the midbrain as the cerebral peduncles, after which it burrows through the pons. Upon entering the medulla, the tracts
make up the large white matter tract referred to as the pyramids (Figure 14.28). The defining landmark of the medullary-
spinal border is the pyramidal decussation, which is where most of the fibers in the corticospinal tract cross over to the
opposite side of the brain. At this point, the tract separates into two parts, which have control over different domains of the
musculature.

Figure 14.28 Corticospinal Tract The major descending tract that controls skeletal muscle movements is the
corticospinal tract. It is composed of two neurons, the upper motor neuron and the lower motor neuron. The upper
motor neuron has its cell body in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe and synapses on the lower motor neuron,
which is in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and projects to the skeletal muscle in the periphery.

Appendicular Control

The lateral corticospinal tract is composed of the fibers that cross the midline at the pyramidal decussation (see Figure
14.28). The axons cross over from the anterior position of the pyramids in the medulla to the lateral column of the spinal
cord. These axons are responsible for controlling appendicular muscles.

This influence over the appendicular muscles means that the lateral corticospinal tract is responsible for moving the
muscles of the arms and legs. The ventral horn in both the lower cervical spinal cord and the lumbar spinal cord both
have wider ventral horns, representing the greater number of muscles controlled by these motor neurons. The cervical
enlargement is particularly large because there is greater control over the fine musculature of the upper limbs, particularly

of the fingers. The lumbar enlargement is not as significant in appearance because there is less fine motor control of the
lower limbs.

Axial Control

The anterior corticospinal tract is responsible for controlling the muscles of the body trunk (see Figure 14.28). These
axons do not decussate in the medulla. Instead, they remain in an anterior position as they descend the brain stem and enter
the spinal cord. These axons then travel to the spinal cord level at which they synapse with a lower motor neuron. Upon
reaching the appropriate level, the axons decussate, entering the ventral horn on the opposite side of the spinal cord from
which they entered. In the ventral horn, these axons synapse with their corresponding lower motor neurons. The lower
motor neurons are located in the medial regions of the ventral horn, because they control the axial muscles of the trunk.

Because movements of the body trunk involve both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract is not entirely
contralateral. Some collateral branches of the tract will project into the ipsilateral ventral horn to control synergistic muscles
on that side of the body, or to inhibit antagonistic muscles through interneurons within the ventral horn. Through the
influence of both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract can coordinate postural muscles in broad movements
of the body. These coordinating axons in the anterior corticospinal tract are often considered bilateral, as they are both
ipsilateral and contralateral.

for the somatic nervous system. The autonomic connections are mentioned, which are covered in another chapter.
From this brief video, only some of the descending motor pathway of the somatic nervous system is described. Which
division of the pathway is described and which division is left out?

Extrapyramidal Controls

Other descending connections between the brain and the spinal cord are called the extrapyramidal system. The name
comes from the fact that this system is outside the corticospinal pathway, which includes the pyramids in the medulla. A
few pathways originating from the brain stem contribute to this system.

The tectospinal tract projects from the midbrain to the spinal cord and is important for postural movements that are
driven by the superior colliculus. The name of the tract comes from an alternate name for the superior colliculus, which is
the tectum. The reticulospinal tract connects the reticular system, a diffuse region of gray matter in the brain stem, with
the spinal cord. This tract influences trunk and proximal limb muscles related to posture and locomotion. The reticulospinal
tract also contributes to muscle tone and influences autonomic functions. The vestibulospinal tract connects the brain stem
nuclei of the vestibular system with the spinal cord. This allows posture, movement, and balance to be modulated on the
basis of equilibrium information provided by the vestibular system.

The pathways of the extrapyramidal system are influenced by subcortical structures. For example, connections between
the secondary motor cortices and the extrapyramidal system modulate spine and cranium movements. The basal nuclei,
which are important for regulating movement initiated by the CNS, influence the extrapyramidal system as well as its
thalamic feedback to the motor cortex.

The conscious movement of our muscles is more complicated than simply sending a single command from the
precentral gyrus down to the proper motor neurons. During the movement of any body part, our muscles relay information
back to the brain, and the brain is constantly sending “revised” instructions back to the muscles. The cerebellum is important
in contributing to the motor system because it compares cerebral motor commands with proprioceptive feedback. The
corticospinal fibers that project to the ventral horn of the spinal cord have branches that also synapse in the pons, which
project to the cerebellum. Also, the proprioceptive sensations of the dorsal column system have a collateral projection to the
medulla that projects to the cerebellum. These two streams of information are compared in the cerebellar cortex. Conflicts
between the motor commands sent by the cerebrum and body position information provided by the proprioceptors cause the
cerebellum to stimulate the red nucleus of the midbrain. The red nucleus then sends corrective commands to the spinal cord
along the rubrospinal tract. The name of this tract comes from the word for red that is seen in the English word “ruby.”


598 CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES

A good example of how the cerebellum corrects cerebral motor commands can be illustrated by walking in water. An
original motor command from the cerebrum to walk will result in a highly coordinated set of learned movements. However,
in water, the body cannot actually perform a typical walking movement as instructed. The cerebellum can alter the motor
command, stimulating the leg muscles to take larger steps to overcome the water resistance. The cerebellum can make
the necessary changes through the rubrospinal tract. Modulating the basic command to walk also relies on spinal reflexes,
but the cerebellum is responsible for calculating the appropriate response. When the cerebellum does not work properly,
coordination and balance are severely affected. The most dramatic example of this is during the overconsumption of alcohol.
Alcohol inhibits the ability of the cerebellum to interpret proprioceptive feedback, making it more difficult to coordinate
body movements, such as walking a straight line, or guide the movement of the hand to touch the tip of the nose.

to control fine movements, such as speech and the movement of limbs. Many of the usual causes were ruled out. It was
not a stroke, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, or thyroid dysfunction. The next most obvious cause was medication, so
her pharmacist had to be consulted. The side effect of a drug meant to help her sleep had resulted in changes in motor
control. What regions of the nervous system are likely to be the focus of haloperidol side effects?

Ventral Horn Output

The somatic nervous system provides output strictly to skeletal muscles. The lower motor neurons, which are responsible
for the contraction of these muscles, are found in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These large, multipolar neurons have
a corona of dendrites surrounding the cell body and an axon that extends out of the ventral horn. This axon travels through
the ventral nerve root to join the emerging spinal nerve. The axon is relatively long because it needs to reach muscles in
the periphery of the body. The diameters of cell bodies may be on the order of hundreds of micrometers to support the long
axon; some axons are a meter in length, such as the lumbar motor neurons that innervate muscles in the first digits of the
feet.

The axons will also branch to innervate multiple muscle fibers. Together, the motor neuron and all the muscle fibers
that it controls make up a motor unit. Motor units vary in size. Some may contain up to 1000 muscle fibers, such as in the
quadriceps, or they may only have 10 fibers, such as in an extraocular muscle. The number of muscle fibers that are part of
a motor unit corresponds to the precision of control of that muscle. Also, muscles that have finer motor control have more
motor units connecting to them, and this requires a larger topographical field in the primary motor cortex.

Motor neuron axons connect to muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction. This is a specialized synaptic structure at
which multiple axon terminals synapse with the muscle fiber sarcolemma. The synaptic end bulbs of the motor neurons
secrete acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the sarcolemma. The binding of acetylcholine opens ligand-gated ion
channels, increasing the movement of cations across the sarcolemma. This depolarizes the sarcolemma, initiating muscle
contraction. Whereas other synapses result in graded potentials that must reach a threshold in the postsynaptic target,
activity at the neuromuscular junction reliably leads to muscle fiber contraction with every nerve impulse received from a
motor neuron. However, the strength of contraction and the number of fibers that contract can be affected by the frequency
of the motor neuron impulses.

Reflexes

This chapter began by introducing reflexes as an example of the basic elements of the somatic nervous system. Simple
somatic reflexes do not include the higher centers discussed for conscious or voluntary aspects of movement. Reflexes
can be spinal or cranial, depending on the nerves and central components that are involved. The example described at
the beginning of the chapter involved heat and pain sensations from a hot stove causing withdrawal of the arm through a
connection in the spinal cord that leads to contraction of the biceps brachii. The description of this withdrawal reflex was
simplified, for the sake of the introduction, to emphasize the parts of the somatic nervous system. But to consider reflexes
fully, more attention needs to be given to this example.

As you withdraw your hand from the stove, you do not want to slow that reflex down. As the biceps brachii contracts,
the antagonistic triceps brachii needs to relax. Because the neuromuscular junction is strictly excitatory, the biceps will

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 599

contract when the motor nerve is active. Skeletal muscles do not actively relax. Instead the motor neuron needs to “quiet
down,” or be inhibited. In the hot-stove withdrawal reflex, this occurs through an interneuron in the spinal cord. The
interneuron’s cell body is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The interneuron receives a synapse from the axon
of the sensory neuron that detects that the hand is being burned. In response to this stimulation from the sensory neuron,
the interneuron then inhibits the motor neuron that controls the triceps brachii. This is done by releasing a neurotransmitter
or other signal that hyperpolarizes the motor neuron connected to the triceps brachii, making it less likely to initiate an
action potential. With this motor neuron being inhibited, the triceps brachii relaxes. Without the antagonistic contraction,
withdrawal from the hot stove is faster and keeps further tissue damage from occurring.

Another example of a withdrawal reflex occurs when you step on a painful stimulus, like a tack or a sharp rock.
The nociceptors that are activated by the painful stimulus activate the motor neurons responsible for contraction of the
tibialis anterior muscle. This causes dorsiflexion of the foot. An inhibitory interneuron, activated by a collateral branch of
the nociceptor fiber, will inhibit the motor neurons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to cancel plantar flexion. An
important difference in this reflex is that plantar flexion is most likely in progress as the foot is pressing down onto the tack.
Contraction of the tibialis anterior is not the most important aspect of the reflex, as continuation of plantar flexion will result
in further damage from stepping onto the tack.

Another type of reflex is a stretch reflex. In this reflex, when a skeletal muscle is stretched, a muscle spindle receptor
is activated. The axon from this receptor structure will cause direct contraction of the muscle. A collateral of the muscle
spindle fiber will also inhibit the motor neuron of the antagonist muscles. The reflex helps to maintain muscles at a constant
length. A common example of this reflex is the knee jerk that is elicited by a rubber hammer struck against the patellar
ligament in a physical exam.

A specialized reflex to protect the surface of the eye is the corneal reflex, or the eye blink reflex. When the cornea
is stimulated by a tactile stimulus, or even by bright light in a related reflex, blinking is initiated. The sensory component
travels through the trigeminal nerve, which carries somatosensory information from the face, or through the optic nerve,
if the stimulus is bright light. The motor response travels through the facial nerve and innervates the orbicularis oculi on
the same side. This reflex is commonly tested during a physical exam using an air puff or a gentle touch of a cotton-tipped
applicator.

reflex, in which the foot flexes dorsally and the toes splay out when the sole of the foot is lightly scratched. This is
normal for newborns, but it is a sign of reduced myelination of the spinal tract in adults. Why would this reflex be a
problem for an adult?

CHAPTER REVIEW

14.1 Sensory Perception

The senses are olfaction (smell), gustation (taste), somatosensation (sensations associated with the skin and body), audition
(hearing), equilibrium (balance), and vision. With the exception of somatosensation, this list represents the special senses,
or those systems of the body that are associated with specific organs such as the tongue or eye. Somatosensation belongs to
the general senses, which are those sensory structures that are distributed throughout the body and in the walls of various
organs. The special senses are all primarily part of the somatic nervous system in that they are consciously perceived
through cerebral processes, though some special senses contribute to autonomic function. The general senses can be divided
into somatosensation, which is commonly considered touch, but includes tactile, pressure, vibration, temperature, and pain
perception. The general senses also include the visceral senses, which are separate from the somatic nervous system function
in that they do not normally rise to the level of conscious perception.

The cells that transduce sensory stimuli into the electrochemical signals of the nervous system are classified on the
basis of structural or functional aspects of the cells. The structural classifications are either based on the anatomy of the
cell that is interacting with the stimulus (free nerve endings, encapsulated endings, or specialized receptor cell), or where
the cell is located relative to the stimulus (interoceptor, exteroceptor, proprioceptor). Thirdly, the functional classification
is based on how the cell transduces the stimulus into a neural signal. Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli and
are the basis for olfaction and gustation. Related to chemoreceptors are osmoreceptors and nociceptors for fluid balance
and pain reception, respectively. Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli and are the basis for most aspects of
somatosensation, as well as being the basis of audition and equilibrium in the inner ear. Thermoreceptors are sensitive to
temperature changes, and photoreceptors are sensitive to light energy.

The nerves that convey sensory information from the periphery to the CNS are either spinal nerves, connected to the
spinal cord, or cranial nerves, connected to the brain. Spinal nerves have mixed populations of fibers; some are motor fibers
and some are sensory. The sensory fibers connect to the spinal cord through the dorsal root, which is attached to the dorsal
root ganglion. Sensory information from the body that is conveyed through spinal nerves will project to the opposite side of
the brain to be processed by the cerebral cortex. The cranial nerves can be strictly sensory fibers, such as the olfactory, optic,
and vestibulocochlear nerves, or mixed sensory and motor nerves, such as the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and
vagus nerves. The cranial nerves are connected to the same side of the brain from which the sensory information originates.

14.2 Central Processing

Sensory input to the brain enters through pathways that travel through either the spinal cord (for somatosensory input from
the body) or the brain stem (for everything else, except the visual and olfactory systems) to reach the diencephalon. In the
diencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus. This is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the cerebral cortex,
except for the olfactory system that is directly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes.

The two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal
column system and the spinothalamic tract. The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is
relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch
and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and
temperature sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds
similar sensation information from the head to these pathways.

The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in the brain stem in which additional information is extracted
from the basic frequency stimuli processed by the cochlea. Sound localization is made possible through the activity of these

CHAPTER 14 | THE BRAIN AND CRANIAL NERVES 607

brain stem structures. The vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and
cerebral cortex.

The visual pathway segregates information from the two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to the other
side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas, the perception of the stimuli and their location is passed along two streams,
one ventral and one dorsal. The ventral visual stream connects to structures in the temporal lobe that are important for long-
term memory formation. The dorsal visual stream interacts with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and together
they can influence the activity in the frontal lobe to generate movements of the body in relation to visual information.

14.3 Motor Responses

The motor components of the somatic nervous system begin with the frontal lobe of the brain, where the prefrontal cortex
is responsible for higher functions such as working memory. The integrative and associate functions of the prefrontal
lobe feed into the secondary motor areas, which help plan movements. The premotor cortex and supplemental motor area
then feed into the primary motor cortex that initiates movements. Large Betz cells project through the corticobulbar and
corticospinal tracts to synapse on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn of the spinal cord, respectively.
These connections are responsible for generating movements of skeletal muscles.

The extrapyramidal system includes projections from the brain stem and higher centers that influence movement,
mostly to maintain balance and posture, as well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus and red nucleus
in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the brain stem each have
tracts projecting to the spinal cord in this system. Descending input from the secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and
cerebellum connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem.

All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord to synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal
cord. These lower motor neurons are the cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause contractions. These neurons project
through the spinal nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular junctions. One motor neuron connects to multiple
muscle fibers within a target muscle. The number of fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron varies on the
basis of the precision necessary for that muscle and the amount of force necessary for that motor unit. The quadriceps, for
example, have many fibers controlled by single motor neurons for powerful contractions that do not need to be precise. The
extraocular muscles have only a small number of fibers controlled by each motor neuron because moving the eyes does not
require much force, but needs to be very precise.

Reflexes are the simplest circuits within the somatic nervous system. A withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus
only requires the sensory fiber that enters the spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a muscle. Antagonist
and postural muscles can be coordinated with the withdrawal, making the connections more complex. The simple, single
neuronal connection is the basis of somatic reflexes. The corneal reflex is contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle to
blink the eyelid when something touches the surface of the eye. Stretch reflexes maintain a constant length of muscles by
causing a contraction of a muscle to compensate for a stretch that can be sensed by a specialized receptor called a muscle
spindle.

cortex. The first half of the pathway is the projection from
the RGCs through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate
nucleus in the thalamus on either side. This first fiber in the
pathway synapses on a thalamic cell that then projects to the
visual cortex in the occipital lobe where “seeing,” or visual
perception, takes place. This video gives an abbreviated
overview of the visual system by concentrating on the
pathway from the eyes to the occipital lobe. The video

to learn more about how the brain perceives 3-D motion.
Similar to how retinal disparity offers 3-D moviegoers a
way to extract 3-D information from the two-dimensional
visual field projected onto the retina, the brain can extract
information about movement in space by comparing what
the two eyes see. If movement of a visual stimulus is
leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the
brain interprets this as movement toward (or away) from the
face along the midline. If both eyes see an object moving
in the same direction, but at different rates, what would that
mean for spatial movement?

Though the threats that modern humans face are not large predators, the autonomic

Introduction

Chapter Objectives

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Describe the components of the autonomic nervous system

* Differentiate between the structures of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions in the autonomic
nervous system

* Name the components of a visceral reflex specific to the autonomic division to which it belongs

* Predict the response of a target effector to autonomic input on the basis of the released signaling molecule

* Describe how the central nervous system coordinates and contributes to autonomic functions

The autonomic nervous system is often associated with the “fight-or-flight response,” which refers to the preparation of the
body to either run away from a threat or to stand and fight in the face of that threat. To suggest what this means, consider the
(very unlikely) situation of seeing a lioness hunting out on the savannah. Though this is not a common threat that humans
deal with in the modern world, it represents the type of environment in which the human species thrived and adapted. The
spread of humans around the world to the present state of the modern age occurred much more quickly than any species
would adapt to environmental pressures such as predators. However, the reactions modern humans have in the modern
world are based on these prehistoric situations. If your boss is walking down the hallway on Friday afternoon looking for

612 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

“volunteers” to come in on the weekend, your response is the same as the prehistoric human seeing the lioness running
across the savannah: fight or flight.

Most likely, your response to your boss—not to mention the lioness—would be flight. Run away! The autonomic
system is responsible for the physiological response to make that possible, and hopefully successful. Adrenaline starts to
flood your circulatory system. Your heart rate increases. Sweat glands become active. The bronchi of the lungs dilate to
allow more air exchange. Pupils dilate to increase visual information. Blood pressure increases in general, and blood vessels
dilate in skeletal muscles. Time to run. Similar physiological responses would occur in preparation for fighting off the threat.

This response should sound a bit familiar. The autonomic nervous system is tied into emotional responses as well, and
the fight-or-flight response probably sounds like a panic attack. In the modern world, these sorts of reactions are associated
with anxiety as much as with response to a threat. It is engrained in the nervous system to respond like this. In fact,
the adaptations of the autonomic nervous system probably predate the human species and are likely to be common to all
mammals, and perhaps shared by many animals. That lioness might herself be threatened in some other situation.

However, the autonomic nervous system is not just about responding to threats. Besides the fight-or-flight response,
there are the responses referred to as “rest and digest.” If that lioness is successful in her hunting, then she is going to rest
from the exertion. Her heart rate will slow. Breathing will return to normal. The digestive system has a big job to do. Much
of the function of the autonomic system is based on the connections within an autonomic, or visceral, reflex.

15.1 | Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Name the components that generate the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the autonomic nervous
system

¢ Explain the differences in output connections within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system

¢ Describe the signaling molecules and receptor proteins involved in communication within the two divisions of the
autonomic nervous system

The nervous system can be divided into two functional parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous
system. The major differences between the two systems are evident in the responses that each produces. The somatic
nervous system causes contraction of skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous system controls cardiac and smooth muscle,
as well as glandular tissue. The somatic nervous system is associated with voluntary responses (though many can happen
without conscious awareness, like breathing), and the autonomic nervous system is associated with involuntary responses,
such as those related to homeostasis.

The autonomic nervous system regulates many of the internal organs through a balance of two aspects, or divisions.
In addition to the endocrine system, the autonomic nervous system is instrumental in homeostatic mechanisms in the body.
The two divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division. The
sympathetic system is associated with the fight-or-flight response, and parasympathetic activity is referred to by the epithet
of rest and digest. Homeostasis is the balance between the two systems. At each target effector, dual innervation determines
activity. For example, the heart receives connections from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. One causes
heart rate to increase, whereas the other causes heart rate to decrease.

response. When someone is said to have a rush of adrenaline, the image of bungee jumpers or skydivers usually comes
to mind. But adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is an important chemical in coordinating the body’s fight-or-flight
response. In this video, you look inside the physiology of the fight-or-flight response, as envisioned for a firefighter.
His body’s reaction is the result of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system causing system-wide
changes as it prepares for extreme responses. What two changes does adrenaline bring about to help the skeletal muscle

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 613

Sympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System

To respond to a threat—to fight or to run away—the sympathetic system causes divergent effects as many different effector
organs are activated together for a common purpose. More oxygen needs to be inhaled and delivered to skeletal muscle. The
respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems are all activated together. Additionally, sweating keeps the excess
heat that comes from muscle contraction from causing the body to overheat. The digestive system shuts down so that blood
is not absorbing nutrients when it should be delivering oxygen to skeletal muscles. To coordinate all these responses, the
connections in the sympathetic system diverge from a limited region of the central nervous system (CNS) to a wide array
of ganglia that project to the many effector organs simultaneously. The complex set of structures that compose the output of
the sympathetic system make it possible for these disparate effectors to come together in a coordinated, systemic change.

The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system influences the various organ systems of the body through
connections emerging from the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord. It is referred to as the thoracolumbar system to
reflect this anatomical basis. A central neuron in the lateral horn of any of these spinal regions projects to ganglia adjacent
to the vertebral column through the ventral spinal roots. The majority of ganglia of the sympathetic system belong to a
network of sympathetic chain ganglia that runs alongside the vertebral column. The ganglia appear as a series of clusters
of neurons linked by axonal bridges. There are typically 23 ganglia in the chain on either side of the spinal column. Three
correspond to the cervical region, 12 are in the thoracic region, four are in the lumbar region, and four correspond to the
sacral region. The cervical and sacral levels are not connected to the spinal cord directly through the spinal roots, but through
ascending or descending connections through the bridges within the chain.

A diagram that shows the connections of the sympathetic system is somewhat like a circuit diagram that shows the
electrical connections between different receptacles and devices. In Figure 15.2, the “circuits” of the sympathetic system
are intentionally simplified.

horn of the spinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to the chain ganglia on either side of the vertebral column or
to collateral (prevertebral) ganglia that are anterior to the vertebral column in the abdominal cavity. Axons from these
ganglionic neurons (postganglionic fibers) then project to target effectors throughout the body.

To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within
the sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion
at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal
nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white
rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see Figure
15.3a). The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic

neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case,
the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons.

In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber
emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior
or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye. The spinal
nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic
neuron (see Figure 15.3b). The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to
prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain.

Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root
continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic
nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain
before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3c).

Collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs
from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal
cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the
superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2). The word celiac is derived from
the Latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers
to the digestive system.

Figure 15.3 Sympathetic Connections and Chain Ganglia The axon from a central sympathetic neuron in the
spinal cord can project to the periphery in a number of different ways. (a) The fiber can project out to the ganglion at
the same level and synapse on a ganglionic neuron. (b) A branch can project to more superior or inferior ganglion in
the chain. (c) A branch can project through the white ramus communicans, but not terminate on a ganglionic neuron in
the chain. Instead, it projects through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion or the adrenal medulla (not
pictured).

An axon from the central neuron that projects to a sympathetic ganglion is referred to as a preganglionic fiber
or neuron, and represents the output from the CNS to the ganglion. Because the sympathetic ganglia are adjacent to
the vertebral column, preganglionic sympathetic fibers are relatively short, and they are myelinated. A postganglionic
fiber—the axon from a ganglionic neuron that projects to the target effector—represents the output of a ganglion that
directly influences the organ. Compared with the preganglionic fibers, postganglionic sympathetic fibers are long because
of the relatively greater distance from the ganglion to the target effector. These fibers are unmyelinated. (Note that the term
“postganglionic neuron” may be used to describe the projection from a ganglion to the target. The problem with that usage
is that the cell body is in the ganglion, and only the fiber is postganglionic. Typically, the term neuron applies to the entire
cell.)

One type of preganglionic sympathetic fiber does not terminate in a ganglion. These are the axons from central
sympathetic neurons that project to the adrenal medulla, the interior portion of the adrenal gland. These axons are still
referred to as preganglionic fibers, but the target is not a ganglion. The adrenal medulla releases signaling molecules into
the bloodstream, rather than using axons to communicate with target structures. The cells in the adrenal medulla that are

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 617

contacted by the preganglionic fibers are called chromaffin cells. These cells are neurosecretory cells that develop from the
neural crest along with the sympathetic ganglia, reinforcing the idea that the gland is, functionally, a sympathetic ganglion.

The projections of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system diverge widely, resulting in a broad
influence of the system throughout the body. As a response to a threat, the sympathetic system would increase heart rate and
breathing rate and cause blood flow to the skeletal muscle to increase and blood flow to the digestive system to decrease.
Sweat gland secretion should also increase as part of an integrated response. All of those physiological changes are going
to be required to occur together to run away from the hunting lioness, or the modern equivalent. This divergence is seen in
the branching patterns of preganglionic sympathetic neurons—a single preganglionic sympathetic neuron may have 10-20
targets. An axon that leaves a central neuron of the lateral horn in the thoracolumbar spinal cord will pass through the white
ramus communicans and enter the sympathetic chain, where it will branch toward a variety of targets. At the level of the
spinal cord at which the preganglionic sympathetic fiber exits the spinal cord, a branch will synapse on a neuron in the
adjacent chain ganglion. Some branches will extend up or down to a different level of the chain ganglia. Other branches
will pass through the chain ganglia and project through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion. Finally,
some branches may project through the splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla. All of these branches mean that one
preganglionic neuron can influence different regions of the sympathetic system very broadly, by acting on widely distributed
organs.

Parasympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System

The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is named because its central neurons are located on either
side of the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord (para- = “beside” or “near”). The parasympathetic system can also be
referred to as the craniosacral system (or outflow) because the preganglionic neurons are located in nuclei of the brain
stem and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord.

The connections, or “circuits,” of the parasympathetic division are similar to the general layout of the sympathetic
division with a few specific differences (Figure 15.4). The preganglionic fibers from the cranial region travel in cranial
nerves, whereas preganglionic fibers from the sacral region travel in spinal nerves. The targets of these fibers are terminal
ganglia, which are located near—or even within—the target effector. These ganglia are often referred to as intramural
ganglia when they are found within the walls of the target organ. The postganglionic fiber projects from the terminal ganglia
a short distance to the target effector, or to the specific target tissue within the organ. Comparing the relative lengths of
axons in the parasympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long and the postganglionic fibers are short because the
ganglia are close to—and sometimes within—the target effectors.

The cranial component of the parasympathetic system is based in particular nuclei of the brain stem. In the midbrain,
the Eddinger—Westphal nucleus is part of the oculomotor complex, and axons from those neurons travel with the fibers
in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) that innervate the extraocular muscles. The preganglionic parasympathetic
fibers within cranial nerve III terminate in the ciliary ganglion, which is located in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic
parasympathetic fibers then project to the smooth muscle of the iris to control pupillary size. In the upper medulla, the
salivatory nuclei contain neurons with axons that project through the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves to ganglia that
control salivary glands. Tear production is influenced by parasympathetic fibers in the facial nerve, which activate a
ganglion, and ultimately the lacrimal (tear) gland. Neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus
ambiguus project through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the terminal ganglia of the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers primarily influence the heart, bronchi, and esophagus in the thoracic cavity and the
stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and small intestine of the abdominal cavity. The postganglionic fibers from the
ganglia activated by the vagus nerve are often incorporated into the structure of the organ, such as the mesenteric plexus
of the digestive tract organs and the intramural ganglia.

Chemical Signaling in the Autonomic Nervous System

Where an autonomic neuron connects with a target, there is a synapse. The electrical signal of the action potential causes
the release of a signaling molecule, which will bind to receptor proteins on the target cell. Synapses of the autonomic

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 619

system are classified as either cholinergic, meaning that acetylcholine (ACh) is released, or adrenergic, meaning that
norepinephrine is released. The terms cholinergic and adrenergic refer not only to the signaling molecule that is released
but also to the class of receptors that each binds.

The cholinergic system includes two classes of receptor: the nicotinic receptor and the muscarinic receptor. Both
receptor types bind to ACh and cause changes in the target cell. The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel
and the muscarinic receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor. The receptors are named for, and differentiated by, other
molecules that bind to them. Whereas nicotine will bind to the nicotinic receptor, and muscarine will bind to the muscarinic
receptor, there is no cross-reactivity between the receptors. The situation is similar to locks and keys. Imagine two
locks—one for a classroom and the other for an office—that are opened by two separate keys. The classroom key will
not open the office door and the office key will not open the classroom door. This is similar to the specificity of nicotine
and muscarine for their receptors. However, a master key can open multiple locks, such as a master key for the Biology
Department that opens both the classroom and the office doors. This is similar to ACh that binds to both types of receptors.
The molecules that define these receptors are not crucial—they are simply tools for researchers to use in the laboratory.
These molecules are exogenous, meaning that they are made outside of the human body, so a researcher can use them
without any confounding endogenous results (results caused by the molecules produced in the body).

The adrenergic system also has two types of receptors, named the alpha (a)-adrenergic receptor and beta (B)-
adrenergic receptor. Unlike cholinergic receptors, these receptor types are not classified by which drugs can bind to them.
All of them are G protein-coupled receptors. There are three types of a-adrenergic receptors, termed a1, «2, and a3, and
there are two types of B-adrenergic receptors, termed 81 and B2. An additional aspect of the adrenergic system is that there
is a second signaling molecule called epinephrine. The chemical difference between norepinephrine and epinephrine is the
addition of a methyl group (CH3) in epinephrine. The prefix “nor-” actually refers to this chemical difference, in which a
methyl group is missing.

The term adrenergic should remind you of the word adrenaline, which is associated with the fight-or-flight response
described at the beginning of the chapter. Adrenaline and epinephrine are two names for the same molecule. The adrenal
gland (in Latin, ad- = “on top of”; renal = “kidney”) secretes adrenaline. The ending “-ine” refers to the chemical being
derived, or extracted, from the adrenal gland. A similar construction from Greek instead of Latin results in the word
epinephrine (epi- = “above”; nephr- = “kidney”). In scientific usage, epinephrine is preferred in the United States, whereas
adrenaline is preferred in Great Britain, because “adrenalin” was once a registered, proprietary drug name in the United
States. Though the drug is no longer sold, the convention of referring to this molecule by the two different names persists.
Similarly, norepinephrine and noradrenaline are two names for the same molecule.

Having understood the cholinergic and adrenergic systems, their role in the autonomic system is relatively simple
to understand. All preganglionic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, release ACh. All ganglionic neurons—the
targets of these preganglionic fibers—have nicotinic receptors in their cell membranes. The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-
gated cation channel that results in depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. The postganglionic parasympathetic
fibers also release ACh, but the receptors on their targets are muscarinic receptors, which are G protein—coupled receptors
and do not exclusively cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release
norepinephrine, except for fibers that project to sweat glands and to blood vessels associated with skeletal muscles, which
release ACh (Table 15.1).

Table 15.1

Signaling molecules can belong to two broad groups. Neurotransmitters are released at synapses, whereas hormones
are released into the bloodstream. These are simplistic definitions, but they can help to clarify this point. Acetylcholine can
be considered a neurotransmitter because it is released by axons at synapses. The adrenergic system, however, presents a
challenge. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, which can be considered a neurotransmitter. But the
adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into circulation, so they should be considered hormones.

What are referred to here as synapses may not fit the strictest definition of synapse. Some sources will refer to the
connection between a postganglionic fiber and a target effector as neuroeffector junctions; neurotransmitters, as defined
above, would be called neuromodulators. The structure of postganglionic connections are not the typical synaptic end bulb
that is found at the neuromuscular junction, but rather are chains of swellings along the length of a postganglionic fiber
called a varicosity (Figure 15.5).

Everyday CONNECTION

Fight or Flight? What About Fright and Freeze?

The original usage of the epithet “fight or flight” comes from a scientist named Walter Cannon who worked at Harvard
in 1915. The concept of homeostasis and the functioning of the sympathetic system had been introduced in France
in the previous century. Cannon expanded the idea, and introduced the idea that an animal responds to a threat by
preparing to stand and fight or run away. The nature of this response was thoroughly explained in a book on the
physiology of pain, hunger, fear, and rage.

When students learn about the sympathetic system and the fight-or-flight response, they often stop and wonder
about other responses. If you were faced with a lioness running toward you as pictured at the beginning of this chapter,
would you run or would you stand your ground? Some people would say that they would freeze and not know what to
do. So isn’t there really more to what the autonomic system does than fight, flight, rest, or digest. What about fear and
paralysis in the face of a threat?

The common epithet of “fight or flight” is being enlarged to be “fight, flight, or fright” or even “fight, flight,
fright, or freeze.” Cannon’s original contribution was a catchy phrase to express some of what the nervous system does
in response to a threat, but it is incomplete. The sympathetic system is responsible for the physiological responses to
emotional states. The name “sympathetic” can be said to mean that (sym- = “together”; -pathos = “pain,” “suffering,”
or “emotion”).

these responses become part of stress and anxiety. This video describes how the autonomic system is only part of the

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 621

15.2 | Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Compare the structure of somatic and autonomic reflex arcs
¢ Explain the differences in sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes
¢ Differentiate between short and long reflexes

¢ Determine the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the regulation of the various organ systems on the basis of
the signaling molecules involved
¢ Describe the effects of drugs that affect autonomic function

The autonomic nervous system regulates organ systems through circuits that resemble the reflexes described in the somatic
nervous system. The main difference between the somatic and autonomic systems is in what target tissues are effectors.
Somatic responses are solely based on skeletal muscle contraction. The autonomic system, however, targets cardiac and
smooth muscle, as well as glandular tissue. Whereas the basic circuit is a reflex arc, there are differences in the structure of
those reflexes for the somatic and autonomic systems.

The Structure of Reflexes

One difference between a somatic reflex, such as the withdrawal reflex, and a visceral reflex, which is an autonomic reflex,
is in the efferent branch. The output of a somatic reflex is the lower motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord
that projects directly to a skeletal muscle to cause its contraction. The output of a visceral reflex is a two-step pathway
starting with the preganglionic fiber emerging from a lateral horn neuron in the spinal cord, or a cranial nucleus neuron in
the brain stem, to a ganglion—followed by the postganglionic fiber projecting to a target effector. The other part of a reflex,
the afferent branch, is often the same between the two systems. Sensory neurons receiving input from the periphery—with
cell bodies in the sensory ganglia, either of a cranial nerve or a dorsal root ganglion adjacent to the spinal cord—project into
the CNS to initiate the reflex (Figure 15.6). The Latin root “effere” means “to carry.” Adding the prefix “ef-” suggests the
meaning “to carry away,” whereas adding the prefix “af-” suggests “to carry toward or inward.”

Figure 15.6 Comparison of Somatic and Visceral Reflexes The afferent inputs to somatic and visceral reflexes
are essentially the same, whereas the efferent branches are different. Somatic reflexes, for instance, involve a direct
connection from the ventral horn of the spinal cord to the skeletal muscle. Visceral reflexes involve a projection from
the central neuron to a ganglion, followed by a second projection from the ganglion to the target effector.

Afferent Branch

The afferent branch of a reflex arc does differ between somatic and visceral reflexes in some instances. Many of the inputs
to visceral reflexes are from special or somatic senses, but particular senses are associated with the viscera that are not part
of the conscious perception of the environment through the somatic nervous system. For example, there is a specific type of
mechanoreceptor, called a baroreceptor, in the walls of the aorta and carotid sinuses that senses the stretch of those organs
when blood volume or pressure increases. You do not have a conscious perception of having high blood pressure, but that is
an important afferent branch of the cardiovascular and, particularly, vasomotor reflexes. The sensory neuron is essentially
the same as any other general sensory neuron. The baroreceptor apparatus is part of the ending of a unipolar neuron that has
a cell body in a sensory ganglion. The baroreceptors from the carotid arteries have axons in the glossopharyngeal nerve, and
those from the aorta have axons in the vagus nerve.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 623

Though visceral senses are not primarily a part of conscious perception, those sensations sometimes make it to
conscious awareness. If a visceral sense is strong enough, it will be perceived. The sensory homunculus—the representation
of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex—only has a small region allotted for the perception of internal stimuli.
If you swallow a large bolus of food, for instance, you will probably feel the lump of that food as it pushes through your
esophagus, or even if your stomach is distended after a large meal. If you inhale especially cold air, you can feel it as it
enters your larynx and trachea. These sensations are not the same as feeling high blood pressure or blood sugar levels.

When particularly strong visceral sensations rise to the level of conscious perception, the sensations are often felt in
unexpected places. For example, strong visceral sensations of the heart will be felt as pain in the left shoulder and left
arm. This irregular pattern of projection of conscious perception of visceral sensations is called referred pain. Depending
on the organ system affected, the referred pain will project to different areas of the body (Figure 15.7). The location of
referred pain is not random, but a definitive explanation of the mechanism has not been established. The most broadly
accepted theory for this phenomenon is that the visceral sensory fibers enter into the same level of the spinal cord as the
somatosensory fibers of the referred pain location. By this explanation, the visceral sensory fibers from the mediastinal
region, where the heart is located, would enter the spinal cord at the same level as the spinal nerves from the shoulder and
arm, so the brain misinterprets the sensations from the mediastinal region as being from the axillary and brachial regions.
Projections from the medial and inferior divisions of the cervical ganglia do enter the spinal cord at the middle to lower
cervical levels, which is where the somatosensory fibers enter.

Nervous System: Kehr’s Sign

Kehr’s sign is the presentation of pain in the left shoulder, chest, and neck regions following rupture of the spleen. The
spleen is in the upper-left abdominopelvic quadrant, but the pain is more in the shoulder and neck. How can this be?
The sympathetic fibers connected to the spleen are from the celiac ganglion, which would be from the mid-thoracic to
lower thoracic region whereas parasympathetic fibers are found in the vagus nerve, which connects in the medulla of
the brain stem. However, the neck and shoulder would connect to the spinal cord at the mid-cervical level of the spinal
cord. These connections do not fit with the expected correspondence of visceral and somatosensory fibers entering at
the same level of the spinal cord.

The incorrect assumption would be that the visceral sensations are coming from the spleen directly. In fact, the
visceral fibers are coming from the diaphragm. The nerve connecting to the diaphragm takes a special route. The
phrenic nerve is connected to the spinal cord at cervical levels 3 to 5. The motor fibers that make up this nerve are
responsible for the muscle contractions that drive ventilation. These fibers have left the spinal cord to enter the phrenic
nerve, meaning that spinal cord damage below the mid-cervical level is not fatal by making ventilation impossible.
Therefore, the visceral fibers from the diaphragm enter the spinal cord at the same level as the somatosensory fibers
from the neck and shoulder.

The diaphragm plays a role in Kehr’s sign because the spleen is just inferior to the diaphragm in the upper-
left quadrant of the abdominopelvic cavity. When the spleen ruptures, blood spills into this region. The accumulating
hemorrhage then puts pressure on the diaphragm. The visceral sensation is actually in the diaphragm, so the referred
pain is in a region of the body that corresponds to the diaphragm, not the spleen.

Efferent Branch

The efferent branch of the visceral reflex arc begins with the projection from the central neuron along the preganglionic
fiber. This fiber then makes a synapse on the ganglionic neuron that projects to the target effector.

The effector organs that are the targets of the autonomic system range from the iris and ciliary body of the eye to the
urinary bladder and reproductive organs. The thoracolumbar output, through the various sympathetic ganglia, reaches all of
these organs. The cranial component of the parasympathetic system projects from the eye to part of the intestines. The sacral
component picks up with the majority of the large intestine and the pelvic organs of the urinary and reproductive systems.

Short and Long Reflexes

Somatic reflexes involve sensory neurons that connect sensory receptors to the CNS and motor neurons that project back out
to the skeletal muscles. Visceral reflexes that involve the thoracolumbar or craniosacral systems share similar connections.
However, there are reflexes that do not need to involve any CNS components. A long reflex has afferent branches that enter
the spinal cord or brain and involve the efferent branches, as previously explained. A short reflex is completely peripheral
and only involves the local integration of sensory input with motor output (Figure 15.8).

Figure 15.8 Short and Long Reflexes Sensory input can stimulate either a short or a long reflex. A sensory neuron
can project to the CNS or to an autonomic ganglion. The short reflex involves the direct stimulation of a postganglionic
fiber by the sensory neuron, whereas the long reflex involves integration in the spinal cord or brain.

The difference between short and long reflexes is in the involvement of the CNS. Somatic reflexes always involve the
CNS, even in a monosynaptic reflex in which the sensory neuron directly activates the motor neuron. That synapse is in
the spinal cord or brain stem, so it has to involve the CNS. However, in the autonomic system there is the possibility that
the CNS is not involved. Because the efferent branch of a visceral reflex involves two neurons—the central neuron and
the ganglionic neuron—a “short circuit” can be possible. If a sensory neuron projects directly to the ganglionic neuron and
causes it to activate the effector target, then the CNS is not involved.

A division of the nervous system that is related to the autonomic nervous system is the enteric nervous system. The
word enteric refers to the digestive organs, so this represents the nervous tissue that is part of the digestive system. There
are a few myenteric plexuses in which the nervous tissue in the wall of the digestive tract organs can directly influence
digestive function. If stretch receptors in the stomach are activated by the filling and distension of the stomach, a short
reflex will directly activate the smooth muscle fibers of the stomach wall to increase motility to digest the excessive food
in the stomach. No CNS involvement is needed because the stretch receptor is directly activating a neuron in the wall of
the stomach that causes the smooth muscle to contract. That neuron, connected to the smooth muscle, is a postganglionic
parasympathetic neuron that can be controlled by a fiber found in the vagus nerve.

Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/strokespell) to learn about a teenager who experiences a series of
spells that suggest a stroke. He undergoes endless tests and seeks input from multiple doctors. In the end, one expert,
one question, and a simple blood pressure cuff answers the question. Why would the heart have to beat faster when the
teenager changes his body position from lying down to sitting, and then to standing?

Balance in Competing Autonomic Reflex Arcs

The autonomic nervous system is important for homeostasis because its two divisions compete at the target effector. The
balance of homeostasis is attributable to the competing inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (dual
innervation). At the level of the target effector, the signal of which system is sending the message is strictly chemical. A
signaling molecule binds to a receptor that causes changes in the target cell, which in turn causes the tissue or organ to
respond to the changing conditions of the body.

Competing Neurotransmitters

The postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions both release neurotransmitters that bind to
receptors on their targets. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, with a minor exception, whereas
postganglionic parasympathetic fibers release ACh. For any given target, the difference in which division of the autonomic
nervous system is exerting control is just in what chemical binds to its receptors. The target cells will have adrenergic and
muscarinic receptors. If norepinephrine is released, it will bind to the adrenergic receptors present on the target cell, and if
ACh is released, it will bind to the muscarinic receptors on the target cell.

In the sympathetic system, there are exceptions to this pattern of dual innervation. The postganglionic sympathetic
‘ibers that contact the blood vessels within skeletal muscle and that contact sweat glands do not release norepinephrine, they
release ACh. This does not create any problem because there is no parasympathetic input to the sweat glands. Sweat glands
have muscarinic receptors and produce and secrete sweat in response to the presence of ACh.

At most of the other targets of the autonomic system, the effector response is based on which neurotransmitter
is released and what receptor is present. For example, regions of the heart that establish heart rate are contacted by
postganglionic fibers from both systems. If norepinephrine is released onto those cells, it binds to an adrenergic receptor that
causes the cells to depolarize faster, and the heart rate increases. If ACh is released onto those cells, it binds to a muscarinic
receptor that causes the cells to hyperpolarize so that they cannot reach threshold as easily, and the heart rate slows. Without
this parasympathetic input, the heart would work at a rate of approximately 100 beats per minute (bpm). The sympathetic
system speeds that up, as it would during exercise, to 120-140 bpm, for example. The parasympathetic system slows it
down to the resting heart rate of 60-80 bpm.

Another example is in the control of pupillary size (Figure 15.9). The afferent branch responds to light hitting the
retina. Photoreceptors are activated, and the signal is transferred to the retinal ganglion cells that send an action potential
along the optic nerve into the diencephalon. If light levels are low, the sympathetic system sends a signal out through the
upper thoracic spinal cord to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic chain. The postganglionic fiber then projects
to the iris, where it releases norepinephrine onto the radial fibers of the iris (a smooth muscle). When those fibers contract,
the pupil dilates—increasing the amount of light hitting the retina. If light levels are too high, the parasympathetic system
sends a signal out from the Eddinger—Westphal nucleus through the oculomotor nerve. This fiber synapses in the ciliary
ganglion in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic fiber then projects to the iris, where it releases ACh onto the circular
fibers of the iris—another smooth muscle. When those fibers contract, the pupil constricts to limit the amount of light hitting
the retina.

Figure 15.9 Autonomic Control of Pupillary Size Activation of the pupillary reflex comes from the amount of light
activating the retinal ganglion cells, as sent along the optic nerve. The output of the sympathetic system projects
through the superior cervical ganglion, whereas the parasympathetic system originates out of the midbrain and projects
through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion, which then projects to the iris. The postganglionic fibers of
either division release neurotransmitters onto the smooth muscles of the iris to cause changes in the pupillary size.
Norepinephrine results in dilation and ACh results in constriction.

In this example, the autonomic system is controlling how much light hits the retina. It is a homeostatic reflex
mechanism that keeps the activation of photoreceptors within certain limits. In the context of avoiding a threat like the
lioness on the savannah, the sympathetic response for fight or flight will increase pupillary diameter so that more light
hits the retina and more visual information is available for running away. Likewise, the parasympathetic response of rest
reduces the amount of light reaching the retina, allowing the photoreceptors to cycle through bleaching and be regenerated
for further visual perception; this is what the homeostatic process is attempting to maintain.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/pupillary) to learn about the pupillary reflexes. The pupillary light
reflex involves sensory input through the optic nerve and motor response through the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary
ganglion, which projects to the circular fibers of the iris. As shown in this short animation, pupils will constrict to limit
the amount of light falling on the retina under bright lighting conditions. What constitutes the afferent and efferent
branches of the competing reflex (dilation)?

Autonomic Tone

Organ systems are balanced between the input from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. When something upsets
that balance, the homeostatic mechanisms strive to return it to its regular state. For each organ system, there may be more
of a sympathetic or parasympathetic tendency to the resting state, which is known as the autonomic tone of the system.
For example, the heart rate was described above. Because the resting heart rate is the result of the parasympathetic system
slowing the heart down from its intrinsic rate of 100 bpm, the heart can be said to be in parasympathetic tone.

In a similar fashion, another aspect of the cardiovascular system is primarily under sympathetic control. Blood
pressure is partially determined by the contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. These tissues have
adrenergic receptors that respond to the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic fibers by constricting
and increasing blood pressure. The hormones released from the adrenal medulla—epinephrine and norepinephrine—will
also bind to these receptors. Those hormones travel through the bloodstream where they can easily interact with the
receptors in the vessel walls. The parasympathetic system has no significant input to the systemic blood vessels, so the
sympathetic system determines their tone.

There are a limited number of blood vessels that respond to sympathetic input in a different fashion. Blood vessels in
skeletal muscle, particularly those in the lower limbs, are more likely to dilate. It does not have an overall effect on blood
pressure to alter the tone of the vessels, but rather allows for blood flow to increase for those skeletal muscles that will be
active in the fight-or-flight response. The blood vessels that have a parasympathetic projection are limited to those in the
erectile tissue of the reproductive organs. Acetylcholine released by these postganglionic parasympathetic fibers cause the
vessels to dilate, leading to the engorgement of the erectile tissue.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 629

Homeostatic MBALANCES

Orthostatic Hypotension

Have you ever stood up quickly and felt dizzy for a moment? This is because, for one reason or another, blood is
not getting to your brain so it is briefly deprived of oxygen. When you change position from sitting or lying down to
standing, your cardiovascular system has to adjust for a new challenge, keeping blood pumping up into the head while
gravity is pulling more and more blood down into the legs.

The reason for this is a sympathetic reflex that maintains the output of the heart in response to postural change.
When a person stands up, proprioceptors indicate that the body is changing position. A signal goes to the CNS, which
then sends a signal to the upper thoracic spinal cord neurons of the sympathetic division. The sympathetic system
then causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict. Both changes will make it possible for the
cardiovascular system to maintain the rate of blood delivery to the brain. Blood is being pumped superiorly through
the internal branch of the carotid arteries into the brain, against the force of gravity. Gravity is not increasing while
standing, but blood is more likely to flow down into the legs as they are extended for standing. This sympathetic reflex
keeps the brain well oxygenated so that cognitive and other neural processes are not interrupted.

Sometimes this does not work properly. If the sympathetic system cannot increase cardiac output, then blood
pressure into the brain will decrease, and a brief neurological loss can be felt. This can be brief, as a slight “wooziness”
when standing up too quickly, or a loss of balance and neurological impairment for a period of time. The name for this
is orthostatic hypotension, which means that blood pressure goes below the homeostatic set point when standing. It
can be the result of standing up faster than the reflex can occur, which may be referred to as a benign “head rush,” or
it may be the result of an underlying cause.

There are two basic reasons that orthostatic hypotension can occur. First, blood volume is too low and the
sympathetic reflex is not effective. This hypovolemia may be the result of dehydration or medications that affect
fluid balance, such as diuretics or vasodilators. Both of these medications are meant to lower blood pressure, which
may be necessary in the case of systemic hypertension, and regulation of the medications may alleviate the problem.
Sometimes increasing fluid intake or water retention through salt intake can improve the situation.

The second underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension is autonomic failure. There are several disorders that
result in compromised sympathetic functions. The disorders range from diabetes to multiple system atrophy (a loss of
control over many systems in the body), and addressing the underlying condition can improve the hypotension. For
example, with diabetes, peripheral nerve damage can occur, which would affect the postganglionic sympathetic fibers.
Getting blood glucose levels under control can improve neurological deficits associated with diabetes.

15.3 | Central Control

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the role of higher centers of the brain in autonomic regulation
¢ Explain the connection of the hypothalamus to homeostasis
¢ Describe the regions of the CNS that link the autonomic system with emotion
* Describe the pathways important to descending control of the autonomic system

The pupillary light reflex (Figure 15.10) begins when light hits the retina and causes a signal to travel along the optic nerve.
This is visual sensation, because the afferent branch of this reflex is simply sharing the special sense pathway. Bright light
hitting the retina leads to the parasympathetic response, through the oculomotor nerve, followed by the postganglionic fiber
from the ciliary ganglion, which stimulates the circular fibers of the iris to contract and constrict the pupil. When light hits
the retina in one eye, both pupils contract. When that light is removed, both pupils dilate again back to the resting position.
When the stimulus is unilateral (presented to only one eye), the response is bilateral (both eyes). The same is not true for
somatic reflexes. If you touch a hot radiator, you only pull that arm back, not both. Central control of autonomic reflexes is
different than for somatic reflexes. The hypothalamus, along with other CNS locations, controls the autonomic system.

Figure 15.10 Pupillary Reflex Pathways The pupil is under competing autonomic control in response to light levels
hitting the retina. The sympathetic system will dilate the pupil when the retina is not receiving enough light, and the
parasympathetic system will constrict the pupil when too much light hits the retina.

Forebrain Structures

Autonomic control is based on the visceral reflexes, composed of the afferent and efferent branches. These homeostatic
mechanisms are based on the balance between the two divisions of the autonomic system, which results in tone for various
organs that is based on the predominant input from the sympathetic or parasympathetic systems. Coordinating that balance
requires integration that begins with forebrain structures like the hypothalamus and continues into the brain stem and spinal
cord.

The Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the control center for many homeostatic mechanisms. It regulates both autonomic function and
endocrine function. The roles it plays in the pupillary reflexes demonstrates the importance of this control center. The optic
nerve projects primarily to the thalamus, which is the necessary relay to the occipital cortex for conscious visual perception.
Another projection of the optic nerve, however, goes to the hypothalamus.

The hypothalamus then uses this visual system input to drive the pupillary reflexes. If the retina is activated by high
levels of light, the hypothalamus stimulates the parasympathetic response. If the optic nerve message shows that low levels
of light are falling on the retina, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic response. Output from the hypothalamus
follows two main tracts, the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus and the medial forebrain bundle (Figure 15.11). Along these
two tracts, the hypothalamus can influence the Eddinger—Westphal nucleus of the oculomotor complex or the lateral horns
of the thoracic spinal cord.

Figure 15.11 Fiber Tracts of the Central Autonomic System The hypothalamus is the source of most of the central
control of autonomic function. It receives input from cerebral structures and projects to brain stem and spinal cord
structures to regulate the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the organ systems of the body. The
main pathways for this are the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus.

These two tracts connect the hypothalamus with the major parasympathetic nuclei in the brain stem and the
preganglionic (central) neurons of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. The hypothalamus also receives input from other areas
of the forebrain through the medial forebrain bundle. The olfactory cortex, the septal nuclei of the basal forebrain, and
the amygdala project into the hypothalamus through the medial forebrain bundle. These forebrain structures inform the
hypothalamus about the state of the nervous system and can influence the regulatory processes of homeostasis. A good
example of this is found in the amygdala, which is found beneath the cerebral cortex of the temporal lobe and plays a role
in our ability to remember and feel emotions.

The Amygdala

The amygdala is a group of nuclei in the medial region of the temporal lobe that is part of the limbic lobe (Figure 15.12).
The limbic lobe includes structures that are involved in emotional responses, as well as structures that contribute to memory
function. The limbic lobe has strong connections with the hypothalamus and influences the state of its activity on the basis of
emotional state. For example, when you are anxious or scared, the amygdala will send signals to the hypothalamus along the
medial forebrain bundle that will stimulate the sympathetic fight-or-flight response. The hypothalamus will also stimulate
the release of stress hormones through its control of the endocrine system in response to amygdala input.

The Medulla

The medulla contains nuclei referred to as the cardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac muscle
of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections. When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system shifts,
such as when blood pressure changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be accomplished within this region.
Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area, the sympathetic system can increase
activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress. The preganglionic sympathetic fibers that
are responsible for increasing heart rate are referred to as the cardiac accelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic
sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting blood vessels compose the vasomotor nerves.

Several brain stem nuclei are important for the visceral control of major organ systems. One brain stem nucleus
involved in cardiovascular function is the solitary nucleus. It receives sensory input about blood pressure and cardiac
function from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, and its output will activate sympathetic stimulation of the heart or
blood vessels through the upper thoracic lateral horn. Another brain stem nucleus important for visceral control is the dorsal
motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which is the motor nucleus for the parasympathetic functions ascribed to the vagus
nerve, including decreasing the heart rate, relaxing bronchial tubes in the lungs, and activating digestive function through
the enteric nervous system. The nucleus ambiguus, which is named for its ambiguous histology, also contributes to the
parasympathetic output of the vagus nerve and targets muscles in the pharynx and larynx for swallowing and speech, as
well as contributing to the parasympathetic tone of the heart along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 633

Everyday CONNECTION

Exercise and the Autonomic System

In addition to its association with the fight-or-flight response and rest-and-digest functions, the autonomic system
is responsible for certain everyday functions. For example, it comes into play when homeostatic mechanisms
dynamically change, such as the physiological changes that accompany exercise. Getting on the treadmill and putting
in a good workout will cause the heart rate to increase, breathing to be stronger and deeper, sweat glands to activate,
and the digestive system to suspend activity. These are the same physiological changes associated with the fight-or-
flight response, but there is nothing chasing you on that treadmill.

This is not a simple homeostatic mechanism at work because “maintaining the internal environment” would mean
getting all those changes back to their set points. Instead, the sympathetic system has become active during exercise so
that your body can cope with what is happening. A homeostatic mechanism is dealing with the conscious decision to
push the body away from a resting state. The heart, actually, is moving away from its homeostatic set point. Without
any input from the autonomic system, the heart would beat at approximately 100 bpm, and the parasympathetic system
slows that down to the resting rate of approximately 70 bpm. But in the middle of a good workout, you should see your
heart rate at 120-140 bpm. You could say that the body is stressed because of what you are doing to it. Homeostatic
mechanisms are trying to keep blood pH in the normal range, or to keep body temperature under control, but those are
in response to the choice to exercise.

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/emotions) to learn about physical responses to emotion. The
autonomic system, which is important for regulating the homeostasis of the organ systems, is also responsible for
our physiological responses to emotions such as fear. The video summarizes the extent of the body’s reactions
and describes several effects of the autonomic system in response to fear. On the basis of what you have already
studied about autonomic function, which effect would you expect to be associated with parasympathetic, rather than
sympathetic, activity?

15.4 | Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ List the classes of pharmaceuticals that interact with the autonomic nervous system
¢ Differentiate between cholinergic and adrenergic compounds
¢ Differentiate between sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs

¢ Relate the consequences of nicotine abuse with respect to autonomic control of the cardiovascular system

An important way to understand the effects of native neurochemicals in the autonomic system is in considering the effects
of pharmaceutical drugs. This can be considered in terms of how drugs change autonomic function. These effects will
primarily be based on how drugs act at the receptors of the autonomic system neurochemistry. The signaling molecules of
the nervous system interact with proteins in the cell membranes of various target cells. In fact, no effect can be attributed
to just the signaling molecules themselves without considering the receptors. A chemical that the body produces to interact
with those receptors is called an endogenous chemical, whereas a chemical introduced to the system from outside is an
exogenous chemical. Exogenous chemicals may be of a natural origin, such as a plant extract, or they may be synthetically
produced in a pharmaceutical laboratory.

634 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

Broad Autonomic Effects

One important drug that affects the autonomic system broadly is not a pharmaceutical therapeutic agent associated with the
system. This drug is nicotine. The effects of nicotine on the autonomic nervous system are important in considering the role
smoking can play in health.

All ganglionic neurons of the autonomic system, in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, are activated by
ACh released from preganglionic fibers. The ACh receptors on these neurons are of the nicotinic type, meaning that they are
ligand-gated ion channels. When the neurotransmitter released from the preganglionic fiber binds to the receptor protein, a
channel opens to allow positive ions to cross the cell membrane. The result is depolarization of the ganglia. Nicotine acts
as an ACh analog at these synapses, so when someone takes in the drug, it binds to these ACh receptors and activates the
ganglionic neurons, causing them to depolarize.

Ganglia of both divisions are activated equally by the drug. For many target organs in the body, this results in no
net change. The competing inputs to the system cancel each other out and nothing significant happens. For example,
the sympathetic system will cause sphincters in the digestive tract to contract, limiting digestive propulsion, but the
parasympathetic system will cause the contraction of other muscles in the digestive tract, which will try to push the contents
of the digestive system along. The end result is that the food does not really move along and the digestive system has not
appreciably changed.

The system in which this can be problematic is in the cardiovascular system, which is why smoking is a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease. First, there is no significant parasympathetic regulation of blood pressure. Only a limited number of
blood vessels are affected by parasympathetic input, so nicotine will preferentially cause the vascular tone to become more
sympathetic, which means blood pressure will be increased. Second, the autonomic control of the heart is special. Unlike
skeletal or smooth muscles, cardiac muscle is intrinsically active, meaning that it generates its own action potentials. The
autonomic system does not cause the heart to beat, it just speeds it up (sympathetic) or slows it down (parasympathetic).
The mechanisms for this are not mutually exclusive, so the heart receives conflicting signals, and the rhythm of the heart
can be affected (Figure 15.13).

Figure 15.13 Autonomic Connections to Heart and Blood Vessels The nicotinic receptor is found on all autonomic
ganglia, but the cardiovascular connections are particular, and do not conform to the usual competitive projections
that would just cancel each other out when stimulated by nicotine. The opposing signals to the heart would both
depolarize and hyperpolarize the heart cells that establish the rhythm of the heartbeat, likely causing arrhythmia. Only
the sympathetic system governs systemic blood pressure so nicotine would cause an increase.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 635

Sympathetic Effect

The neurochemistry of the sympathetic system is based on the adrenergic system. Norepinephrine and epinephrine influence
target effectors by binding to the a-adrenergic or B-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that affect the sympathetic system affect
these chemical systems. The drugs can be classified by whether they enhance the functions of the sympathetic system or
interrupt those functions. A drug that enhances adrenergic function is known as a sympathomimetic drug, whereas a drug
that interrupts adrenergic function is a sympatholytic drug.

Sympathomimetic Drugs

When the sympathetic system is not functioning correctly or the body is in a state of homeostatic imbalance, these drugs
act at postganglionic terminals and synapses in the sympathetic efferent pathway. These drugs either bind to particular
adrenergic receptors and mimic norepinephrine at the synapses between sympathetic postganglionic fibers and their
targets, or they increase the production and release of norepinephrine from postganglionic fibers. Also, to increase the
effectiveness of adrenergic chemicals released from the fibers, some of these drugs may block the removal or reuptake of
the neurotransmitter from the synapse.

A common sympathomimetic drug is phenylephrine, which is a common component of decongestants. It can also be
used to dilate the pupil and to raise blood pressure. Phenylephrine is known as an a-adrenergic agonist, meaning that
it binds to a specific adrenergic receptor, stimulating a response. In this role, phenylephrine will bind to the adrenergic
receptors in bronchioles of the lungs and cause them to dilate. By opening these structures, accumulated mucus can be
cleared out of the lower respiratory tract. Phenylephrine is often paired with other pharmaceuticals, such as analgesics, as

in the “sinus” version of many over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol Sinus” or Excedrin Sinus®, or in expectorants for

chest congestion such as in Robitussin CF®.

A related molecule, called pseudoephedrine, was much more commonly used in these applications than was
phenylephrine, until the molecule became useful in the illicit production of amphetamines. Phenylephrine is not as effective
as a drug because it can be partially broken down in the digestive tract before it is ever absorbed. Like the adrenergic agents,
phenylephrine is effective in dilating the pupil, known as mydriasis (Figure 15.14). Phenylephrine is used during an eye
exam in an ophthalmologist’s or optometrist’s office for this purpose. It can also be used to increase blood pressure in
situations in which cardiac function is compromised, such as under anesthesia or during septic shock.

Figure 15.14 Mydriasis The sympathetic system causes pupillary dilation when norepinephrine binds to an
adrenergic receptor in the radial fibers of the iris smooth muscle. Phenylephrine mimics this action by binding to the
same receptor when drops are applied onto the surface of the eye in a doctor’s office. (credit: Corey Theiss)

Other drugs that enhance adrenergic function are not associated with therapeutic uses, but affect the functions of the
sympathetic system in a similar fashion. Cocaine primarily interferes with the uptake of dopamine at the synapse and can
also increase adrenergic function. Caffeine is an antagonist to a different neurotransmitter receptor, called the adenosine
receptor. Adenosine will suppress adrenergic activity, specifically the release of norepinephrine at synapses, so caffeine
indirectly increases adrenergic activity. There is some evidence that caffeine can aid in the therapeutic use of drugs, perhaps
by potentiating (increasing) sympathetic function, as is suggested by the inclusion of caffeine in over-the-counter analgesics

such as Excedrin®.
Sympatholytic Drugs

Drugs that interfere with sympathetic function are referred to as sympatholytic, or sympathoplegic, drugs. They primarily
work as an antagonist to the adrenergic receptors. They block the ability of norepinephrine or epinephrine to bind to the

636 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

receptors so that the effect is “cut” or “takes a blow,” to refer to the endings “-lytic” and “-plegic,” respectively. The various
drugs of this class will be specific to a-adrenergic or B-adrenergic receptors, or to their receptor subtypes.

Possibly the most familiar type of sympatholytic drug are the B-blockers. These drugs are often used to treat
cardiovascular disease because they block the B-receptors associated with vasoconstriction and cardioacceleration. By
allowing blood vessels to dilate, or keeping heart rate from increasing, these drugs can improve cardiac function in a
compromised system, such as for a person with congestive heart failure or who has previously suffered a heart attack. A
couple of common versions of B-blockers are metaprolol, which specifically blocks the B2-receptor, and propanolol, which
nonspecifically blocks B-receptors. There are other drugs that are a-blockers and can affect the sympathetic system in a
similar way.

Other uses for sympatholytic drugs are as antianxiety medications. A common example of this is clonidine, which is an
a-blocker. The sympathetic system is tied to anxiety to the point that the sympathetic response can be referred to as “fight,
flight, or fright.” Clonidine is used for other treatments aside from hypertension and anxiety, including pain conditions and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Parasympathetic Effects

Drugs affecting parasympathetic functions can be classified into those that increase or decrease activity at postganglionic
terminals. Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers release ACh, and the receptors on the targets are muscarinic receptors.
There are several types of muscarinic receptors, M1—M5, but the drugs are not usually specific to the specific types.
Parasympathetic drugs can be either muscarinic agonists or antagonists, or have indirect effects on the cholinergic system.
Drugs that enhance cholinergic effects are called parasympathomimetic drugs, whereas those that inhibit cholinergic
effects are referred to as anticholinergic drugs.

Pilocarpine is a nonspecific muscarinic agonist commonly used to treat disorders of the eye. It reverses mydriasis, such
as is caused by phenylephrine, and can be administered after an eye exam. Along with constricting the pupil through the
smooth muscle of the iris, pilocarpine will also cause the ciliary muscle to contract. This will open perforations at the base
of the cornea, allowing for the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior compartment of the eye and, therefore, reducing
intraocular pressure related to glaucoma.

Atropine and scopolamine are part of a class of muscarinic antagonists that come from the Atropa genus of plants that
include belladonna or deadly nightshade (Figure 15.15). The name of one of these plants, belladonna, refers to the fact
that extracts from this plant were used cosmetically for dilating the pupil. The active chemicals from this plant block the
muscarinic receptors in the iris and allow the pupil to dilate, which is considered attractive because it makes the eyes appear
larger. Humans are instinctively attracted to anything with larger eyes, which comes from the fact that the ratio of eye-to-
head size is different in infants (or baby animals) and can elicit an emotional response. The cosmetic use of belladonna
extract was essentially acting on this response. Atropine is no longer used in this cosmetic capacity for reasons related to the
other name for the plant, which is deadly nightshade. Suppression of parasympathetic function, especially when it becomes
systemic, can be fatal. Autonomic regulation is disrupted and anticholinergic symptoms develop. The berries of this plant
are highly toxic, but can be mistaken for other berries. The antidote for atropine or scopolamine poisoning is pilocarpine.

Figure 15.15 Belladonna Plant The plant from the genus Atropa, which is known as belladonna or deadly
nightshade, was used cosmetically to dilate pupils, but can be fatal when ingested. The berries on the plant may seem
attractive as a fruit, but they contain the same anticholinergic compounds as the rest of the plant.

Autonomic Nervous System

Approximately 33 percent of people experience a mild problem with motion sickness, whereas up to 66 percent
experience motion sickness under extreme conditions, such as being on a tossing boat with no view of the horizon.
Connections between regions in the brain stem and the autonomic system result in the symptoms of nausea, cold
sweats, and vomiting.

The part of the brain responsible for vomiting, or emesis, is known as the area postrema. It is located next
to the fourth ventricle and is not restricted by the blood-brain barrier, which allows it to respond to chemicals in
the bloodstream—namely, toxins that will stimulate emesis. There are significant connections between this area, the
solitary nucleus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. These autonomic system and nuclei connections are
associated with the symptoms of motion sickness.

Motion sickness is the result of conflicting information from the visual and vestibular systems. If motion is
perceived by the visual system without the complementary vestibular stimuli, or through vestibular stimuli without
visual confirmation, the brain stimulates emesis and the associated symptoms. The area postrema, by itself, appears to
be able to stimulate emesis in response to toxins in the blood, but it is also connected to the autonomic system and can
trigger a similar response to motion.

Autonomic drugs are used to combat motion sickness. Though it is often described as a dangerous and deadly
drug, scopolamine is used to treat motion sickness. A popular treatment for motion sickness is the transdermal
scopolamine patch. Scopolamine is one of the substances derived from the Atropa genus along with atropine. At higher
doses, those substances are thought to be poisonous and can lead to an extreme sympathetic syndrome. However,
the transdermal patch regulates the release of the drug, and the concentration is kept very low so that the dangers
are avoided. For those who are concerned about using “The Most Dangerous Drug,” as some websites will call it,

antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine®) can be used.

CHAPTER REVIEW

15.1 Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System

The primary responsibilities of the autonomic nervous system are to regulate homeostatic mechanisms in the body, which
is also part of what the endocrine system does. The key to understanding the autonomic system is to explore the response
pathways—the output of the nervous system. The way we respond to the world around us, to manage the internal
environment on the basis of the external environment, is divided between two parts of the autonomic nervous system.
The sympathetic division responds to threats and produces a readiness to confront the threat or to run away: the fight-or-

641

642 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

flight response. The parasympathetic division plays the opposite role. When the external environment does not present any
immediate danger, a restful mode descends on the body, and the digestive system is more active.

The sympathetic output of the nervous system originates out of the lateral horn of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. An
axon from one of these central neurons projects by way of the ventral spinal nerve root and spinal nerve to a sympathetic
ganglion, either in the sympathetic chain ganglia or one of the collateral locations, where it synapses on a ganglionic neuron.
These preganglionic fibers release ACh, which excites the ganglionic neuron through the nicotinic receptor. The axon from
the ganglionic neuron—the postganglionic fiber—then projects to a target effector where it will release norepinephrine
to bind to an adrenergic receptor, causing a change in the physiology of that organ in keeping with the broad, divergent
sympathetic response. The postganglionic connections to sweat glands in the skin and blood vessels supplying skeletal
muscle are, however, exceptions; those fibers release ACh onto muscarinic receptors. The sympathetic system has a
specialized preganglionic connection to the adrenal medulla that causes epinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into
the bloodstream rather than exciting a neuron that contacts an organ directly. This hormonal component means that the
sympathetic chemical signal can spread throughout the body very quickly and affect many organ systems at once.

The parasympathetic output is based in the brain stem and sacral spinal cord. Neurons from particular nuclei in the
brain stem or from the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to terminal (intramural) ganglia
located close to or within the wall of target effectors. These preganglionic fibers also release ACh onto nicotinic receptors
to excite the ganglionic neurons. The postganglionic fibers then contact the target tissues within the organ to release ACh,
which binds to muscarinic receptors to induce rest-and-digest responses.
Signaling molecules utilized by the autonomic nervous system are released from axons and can be considered as
either neurotransmitters (when they directly interact with the effector) or as hormones (when they are released into the
bloodstream). The same molecule, such as norepinephrine, could be considered either a neurotransmitter or a hormone on
the basis of whether it is released from a postganglionic sympathetic axon or from the adrenal gland. The synapses in the
autonomic system are not always the typical type of connection first described in the neuromuscular junction. Instead of
having synaptic end bulbs at the very end of an axonal fiber, they may have swellings—called varicosities—along the length
of a fiber so that it makes a network of connections within the target tissue.

15.2 Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis

Autonomic nervous system function is based on the visceral reflex. This reflex is similar to the somatic reflex, but the
efferent branch is composed of two neurons. The central neuron projects from the spinal cord or brain stem to synapse on
the ganglionic neuron that projects to the effector. The afferent branch of the somatic and visceral reflexes is very similar, as
many somatic and special senses activate autonomic responses. However, there are visceral senses that do not form part of
conscious perception. If a visceral sensation, such as cardiac pain, is strong enough, it will rise to the level of consciousness.
However, the sensory homunculus does not provide a representation of the internal structures to the same degree as the
surface of the body, so visceral sensations are often experienced as referred pain, such as feelings of pain in the left shoulder
and arm in connection with a heart attack.

The role of visceral reflexes is to maintain a balance of function in the organ systems of the body. The two divisions
of the autonomic system each play a role in effecting change, usually in competing directions. The sympathetic system
increases heart rate, whereas the parasympathetic system decreases heart rate. The sympathetic system dilates the pupil of
the eye, whereas the parasympathetic system constricts the pupil. The competing inputs can contribute to the resting tone of
the organ system. Heart rate is normally under parasympathetic tone, whereas blood pressure is normally under sympathetic
tone. The heart rate is slowed by the autonomic system at rest, whereas blood vessels retain a slight constriction at rest.

In a few systems of the body, the competing input from the two divisions is not the norm. The sympathetic tone of
blood vessels is caused by the lack of parasympathetic input to the systemic circulatory system. Only certain regions receive
parasympathetic input that relaxes the smooth muscle wall of the blood vessels. Sweat glands are another example, which
only receive input from the sympathetic system.

15.3 Central Control

The autonomic system integrates sensory information and higher cognitive processes to generate output, which balances
homeostatic mechanisms. The central autonomic structure is the hypothalamus, which coordinates sympathetic and
parasympathetic efferent pathways to regulate activities of the organ systems of the body. The majority of hypothalamic
output travels through the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus to influence brain stem and spinal
components of the autonomic nervous system. The medial forebrain bundle also connects the hypothalamus with higher
centers of the limbic system where emotion can influence visceral responses. The amygdala is a structure within the limbic
system that influences the hypothalamus in the regulation of the autonomic system, as well as the endocrine system.

These higher centers have descending control of the autonomic system through brain stem centers, primarily in the
medulla, such as the cardiovascular center. This collection of medullary nuclei regulates cardiac function, as well as blood
pressure. Sensory input from the heart, aorta, and carotid sinuses project to these regions of the medulla. The solitary
nucleus increases sympathetic tone of the cardiovascular system through the cardiac accelerator and vasomotor nerves. The
nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor nucleus both contribute fibers to the vagus nerve, which exerts parasympathetic
control of the heart by decreasing heart rate.

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 643

15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System

The autonomic system is affected by a number of exogenous agents, including some that are therapeutic and some that are
illicit. These drugs affect the autonomic system by mimicking or interfering with the endogenous agents or their receptors.
A survey of how different drugs affect autonomic function illustrates the role that the neurotransmitters and hormones play
in autonomic function. Drugs can be thought of as chemical tools to effect changes in the system with some precision, based
on where those drugs are effective.

Nicotine is not a drug that is used therapeutically, except for smoking cessation. When it is introduced into the body
via products, it has broad effects on the autonomic system. Nicotine carries a risk for cardiovascular disease because of
these broad effects. The drug stimulates both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia at the preganglionic fiber synapse.
For most organ systems in the body, the competing input from the two postganglionic fibers will essentially cancel each
other out. However, for the cardiovascular system, the results are different. Because there is essentially no parasympathetic
influence on blood pressure for the entire body, the sympathetic input is increased by nicotine, causing an increase in
blood pressure. Also, the influence that the autonomic system has on the heart is not the same as for other systems. Other
organs have smooth muscle or glandular tissue that is activated or inhibited by the autonomic system. Cardiac muscle is
intrinsically active and is modulated by the autonomic system. The contradictory signals do not just cancel each other out,
they alter the regularity of the heart rate and can cause arrhythmias. Both hypertension and arrhythmias are risk factors for
heart disease.

Other drugs affect one division of the autonomic system or the other. The sympathetic system is affected by drugs that
mimic the actions of adrenergic molecules (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and are called sympathomimetic drugs. Drugs
such as phenylephrine bind to the adrenergic receptors and stimulate target organs just as sympathetic activity would. Other
drugs are sympatholytic because they block adrenergic activity and cancel the sympathetic influence on the target organ.
Drugs that act on the parasympathetic system also work by either enhancing the postganglionic signal or blocking it. A
muscarinic agonist (or parasympathomimetic drug) acts just like ACh released by the parasympathetic postganglionic fiber.

Anticholinergic drugs block muscarinic receptors, suppressing parasympathetic interaction with the organ.

EXAM

Health care professionals, such as this air force nurse, can rapidly assess the
neurological functions of a patient using the neurological exam. One part of the exam is the inspection of the oral cavity
and pharynx, which enables the doctor to not only inspect the tissues for signs of infection, but also provides a means
to test the functions of the cranial nerves associated with the oral cavity. (credit: U.S. Department of Defense)

the central nervous system (CNS). The problem is finding where in the entire nervous system the stroke has occurred. By
checking reflexes, sensory responses, and motor control, a health care provider can focus on what abilities the patient may
have lost as a result of the stroke and can use this information to determine where the injury occurred. In the emergency
department of the hospital, this kind of rapid assessment of neurological function is key to treating trauma to the nervous
system. In the classroom, the neurological exam is a valuable tool for learning the anatomy and physiology of the nervous
system because it allows you to relate the functions of the system to particular locations in the nervous system.

As a student of anatomy and physiology, you may be planning to go into an allied health field, perhaps nursing or
physical therapy. You could be in the emergency department treating a patient such as the one just described. An important
part of this course is to understand the nervous system. This can be especially challenging because you need to learn about
the nervous system using your own nervous system. The first chapter in this unit about the nervous system began with a
quote: “If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to understand it.” However,
you are being asked to understand aspects of it. A healthcare provider can pinpoint problems with the nervous system in
minutes by running through the series of tasks to test neurological function that are described in this chapter. You can use
the same approach, though not as quickly, to learn about neurological function and its relationship to the structures of the
nervous system.

Nervous tissue is different from other tissues in that it is not classified into separate tissue types. It does contain two
types of cells, neurons and glia, but it is all just nervous tissue. White matter and gray matter are not types of nervous tissue,
but indications of different specializations within the nervous tissue. However, not all nervous tissue performs the same
‘unction. Furthermore, specific functions are not wholly localized to individual brain structures in the way that other bodily
‘unctions occur strictly within specific organs. In the CNS, we must consider the connections between cells over broad
areas, not just the function of cells in one particular nucleus or region. In a broad sense, the nervous system is responsible
or the majority of electrochemical signaling in the body, but the use of those signals is different in various regions.

The nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord as the central organs, and the ganglia and nerves as organs
in the periphery. The brain and spinal cord can be thought of as a collection of smaller organs, most of which would be the
nuclei (such as the oculomotor nuclei), but white matter structures play an important role (such as the corpus callosum).
Studying the nervous system requires an understanding of the varied physiology of the nervous system. For example, the
hypothalamus plays a very different role than the visual cortex. The neurological exam provides a way to elicit behavior
that represents those varied functions.

16.1 | Overview of the Neurological Exam

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ List the major sections of the neurological exam
¢ Explain the connection between location and function in the nervous system
¢ Explain the benefit of a rapid assessment for neurological function in a clinical setting
¢ List the causes of neurological deficits
* Describe the different ischemic events in the nervous system

The neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are affected by
damage or disease. It can be performed in a short time—sometimes as quickly as 5 minutes—to establish neurological
function. In the emergency department, this rapid assessment can make the difference with respect to proper treatment and
the extent of recovery that is possible.

The exam is a series of subtests separated into five major sections. The first of these is the mental status exam,
which assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory, orientation, and language. Then there is the cranial nerve
exam, which tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral structures associated
with them. The cranial nerve exam tests the sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as applicable. Two major
sections, the sensory exam and the motor exam, test the sensory and motor functions associated with spinal nerves. Finally,
the coordination exam tests the ability to perform complex and coordinated movements. The gait exam, which is often
considered a sixth major exam, specifically assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of the
coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.

Neuroanatomy and the Neurological Exam

Localization of function is the concept that circumscribed locations are responsible for specific functions. The neurological
exam highlights this relationship. For example, the cognitive functions that are assessed in the mental status exam are based
on functions in the cerebrum, mostly in the cerebral cortex. Several of the subtests examine language function. Deficits in
neurological function uncovered by these examinations usually point to damage to the left cerebral cortex. In the majority
of individuals, language function is localized to the left hemisphere between the superior temporal lobe and the posterior
frontal lobe, including the intervening connections through the inferior parietal lobe.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 649

The five major sections of the neurological exam are related to the major regions of the CNS (Figure 16.2). The
mental status exam assesses functions related to the cerebrum. The cranial nerve exam is for the nerves that connect to the
diencephalon and brain stem (as well as the olfactory connections to the forebrain). The coordination exam and the related
gait exam primarily assess the functions of the cerebellum. The motor and sensory exams are associated with the spinal cord
and its connections through the spinal nerves.

Figure 16.2 Anatomical Underpinnings of the Neurological Exam The different regions of the CNS relate to the
major sections of the neurological exam: the mental status exam, cranial nerve exam, sensory exam, motor exam, and
coordination exam (including the gait exam).

Part of the power of the neurological exam is this link between structure and function. Testing the various functions
represented in the exam allows an accurate estimation of where the nervous system may be damaged. Consider the patient
described in the chapter introduction. In the emergency department, he is given a quick exam to find where the deficit may
be localized. Knowledge of where the damage occurred will lead to the most effective therapy.

In rapid succession, he is asked to smile, raise his eyebrows, stick out his tongue, and shrug his shoulders. The doctor
tests muscular strength by providing resistance against his arms and legs while he tries to lift them. With his eyes closed,
he has to indicate when he feels the tip of a pen touch his legs, arms, fingers, and face. He follows the tip of a pen as the
doctor moves it through the visual field and finally toward his face. A formal mental status exam is not needed at this point;
the patient will demonstrate any possible deficits in that area during normal interactions with the interviewer. If cognitive
or language deficits are apparent, the interviewer can pursue mental status in more depth. All of this takes place in less than
5 minutes. The patient reports that he feels pins and needles in his left arm and leg, and has trouble feeling the tip of the
pen when he is touched on those limbs. This suggests a problem with the sensory systems between the spinal cord and the
brain. The emergency department has a lead to follow before a CT scan is performed. He is put on aspirin therapy to limit
the possibility of blood clots forming, in case the cause is an embolus—an obstruction such as a blood clot that blocks the
flow of blood in an artery or vein.


650 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/neuroexam) to see a demonstration of the neurological exam—a series
of tests that can be performed rapidly when a patient is initially brought into an emergency department. The exam can
be repeated on a regular basis to keep a record of how and if neurological function changes over time. In what order
were the sections of the neurological exam tested in this video, and which section seemed to be left out?

Causes of Neurological Deficits

Damage to the nervous system can be limited to individual structures or can be distributed across broad areas of the brain
and spinal cord. Localized, limited injury to the nervous system is most often the result of circulatory problems. Neurons
are very sensitive to oxygen deprivation and will start to deteriorate within 1 or 2 minutes, and permanent damage (cell
death) could result within a few hours. The loss of blood flow to part of the brain is known as a stroke, or a cerebrovascular
accident (CVA).

There are two main types of stroke, depending on how the blood supply is compromised: ischemic and hemorrhagic.
An ischemic stroke is the loss of blood flow to an area because vessels are blocked or narrowed. This is often caused by an
embolus, which may be a blood clot or fat deposit. Ischemia may also be the result of thickening of the blood vessel wall,
or a drop in blood volume in the brain known as hypovolemia.

A related type of CVA is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is similar to a stroke although it does
not last as long. The diagnostic definition of a stroke includes effects that last at least 24 hours. Any stroke symptoms that
are resolved within a 24-hour period because of restoration of adequate blood flow are classified as a TIA.

A hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding into the brain because of a damaged blood vessel. Accumulated blood fills a region
of the cranial vault and presses against the tissue in the brain (Figure 16.3). Physical pressure on the brain can cause the
loss of function, as well as the squeezing of local arteries resulting in compromised blood flow beyond the site of the
hemorrhage. As blood pools in the nervous tissue and the vasculature is damaged, the blood-brain barrier can break down
and allow additional fluid to accumulate in the region, which is known as edema.

(a)

of blood (bottom arrow) with an additional edema in the adjacent tissue (top arrow). The hemorrhagic area causes the

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 651

Whereas hemorrhagic stroke may involve bleeding into a large region of the CNS, such as into the deep white matter
of a cerebral hemisphere, other events can cause widespread damage and loss of neurological functions. Infectious diseases
can lead to loss of function throughout the CNS as components of nervous tissue, specifically astrocytes and microglia,
react to the disease. Blunt force trauma, such as from a motor vehicle accident, can physically damage the CNS.

A class of disorders that affect the nervous system are the neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s disease,
Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeld—Jacob disease, multiple sclerosis
(MS), and other disorders that are the result of nervous tissue degeneration. In diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or
ALS, neurons die; in diseases like MS, myelin is affected. Some of these disorders affect motor function, and others present
with dementia. How patients with these disorders perform in the neurological exam varies, but is often broad in its effects,
such as memory deficits that compromise many aspects of the mental status exam, or movement deficits that compromise
aspects of the cranial nerve exam, the motor exam, or the coordination exam. The causes of these disorders are also varied.
Some are the result of genetics, such as Huntington’s disease, or the result of autoimmunity, such as MS; others are not
entirely understood, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Current research suggests that many of these diseases
are related in how the degeneration takes place and may be treated by common therapies.

Finally, a common cause of neurological changes is observed in developmental disorders. Whether the result of
genetic factors or the environment during development, there are certain situations that result in neurological functions
being different from the expected norms. Developmental disorders are difficult to define because they are caused by
defects that existed in the past and disrupted the normal development of the CNS. These defects probably involve multiple
environmental and genetic factors—most of the time, we don’t know what the cause is other than that it is more complex
than just one factor. Furthermore, each defect on its own may not be a problem, but when several are added together, they
can disrupt growth processes that are not well understand in the first place. For instance, it is possible for a stroke to damage
a specific region of the brain and lead to the loss of the ability to recognize faces (prosopagnosia). The link between cell
death in the fusiform gyrus and the symptom is relatively easy to understand. In contrast, similar deficits can be seen in
children with the developmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these children do not lack a fusiform
gyrus, nor is there any damage or defect visible to this brain region. We conclude, rather poorly, that this brain region is not
connected properly to other brain regions.

Infection, trauma, and congenital disorders can all lead to significant signs, as identified through the neurological exam.
It is important to differentiate between an acute event, such as stroke, and a chronic or global condition such as blunt force
trauma. Responses seen in the neurological exam can help. A loss of language function observed in all its aspects is more
likely a global event as opposed to a discrete loss of one function, such as not being able to say certain types of words.
A concern, however, is that a specific function—such as controlling the muscles of speech—may mask other language
functions. The various subtests within the mental status exam can address these finer points and help clarify the underlying
cause of the neurological loss.

the neurological exam can give insight into how structure and function in the nervous system are interdependent.
This is a tool both in the clinic and in the classroom, but for different reasons. In the clinic, this is a powerful but
simple tool to assess a patient’s neurological function. In the classroom, it is a different way to think about the nervous
system. Though medical technology provides noninvasive imaging and real-time functional data, the presenter says
these cannot replace the history at the core of the medical examination. What does history mean in the context of
medical practice?

THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

The Mental Status Exam

of this section, you will be able to:
‘ibe the relationship of mental status exam results to cerebral functions

in the categorization of regions of the cortex based on anatomy and physiology

¢ Differentiate between primary, association, and integration areas of the cerebral cortex

¢ Provide examples of localization of function related to the cerebral cortex

In the clinical setting, the set of subtests known as the mental status exam helps us understand the relationship of the brain to
the body. Ultimately, this is accomplished by assessing behavior. Tremors related to intentional movements, incoordination,
or the neglect of one side of the body can be indicative of failures of the connections of the cerebrum either within the
hemispheres, or from the cerebrum to other portions of the nervous system. There is no strict test for what the cerebrum
does alone, but rather in what it does through its control of the rest of the CNS, the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and

the musculature.

Sometimes eliciting a behavior is as simple as asking a question. Asking a patient to state his or her name is not only
to verify that the file folder in a health care provider’s hands is the correct one, but also to be sure that the patient is aware,
oriented, and capable of interacting with another person. If the answer to “What is your name?” is “Santa Claus,” the person
may have a problem understanding reality. If the person just stares at the examiner with a confused look on their face, the
person may have a problem understanding or producing speech.

Functio

ns of the Cerebral Cortex

The cerebrum is the seat of many of the higher mental functions, such as memory and learning, language, and conscious
perception, which are the subjects of subtests of the mental status exam. The cerebral cortex is the thin layer of gray matter

on the outside of the cerebrum. It is approximately a millimeter thick in most regions and highly folded to fit within the
limited space of the cranial vault. These higher functions are distributed across various regions of the cortex, and specific
locations can be said to be responsible for particular functions. There is a limited set of regions, for example, that are

involved in
governs.
The ba:

anatomical underpinnings. The German neurologist and histologist Korbinian Brodmann, who made a careful study of the
cytoarchitecture of the cerebrum around the turn of the nineteenth century, described approximately 50 regions of the
cortex that differed enough from each other to be considered separate areas (Figure 16.4). Brodmann made preparations

of many dif:

of neurons to find anatomical differences in the various parts of the cerebral cortex. Continued investigation into these
anatomical areas over the subsequent 100 or more years has demonstrated a strong correlation between the structures and the
functions attributed to those structures. For example, the first three areas in Brodmann’s list—which are in the postcentral

gyrus—com,

anguage function, and they can be subdivided on the basis of the particular part of language function that each

sis for parceling out areas of the cortex and attributing them to various functions has its root in pure

erent regions of the cerebral cortex to view with a microscope. He compared the size, shape, and number

pose the primary somatosensory cortex. Within this area, finer separation can be made on the basis of the

concept of the sensory homunculus, as well as the different submodalities of somatosensation such as touch, vibration, pain,

temperature,

or proprioception. Today, we more frequently refer to these regions by their function (i.e., primary sensory

cortex) than

by the number Brodmann assigned to them, but in some situations the use of Brodmann numbers persists.

Figure 16.4 Brodmann's Areas of the Cerebral Cortex On the basis of cytoarchitecture, the anatomist Korbinian
Brodmann described the extensive array of cortical regions, as illustrated in his figure. Subsequent investigations found
that these areas corresponded very well to functional differences in the cerebral cortex. (credit: modification of work by
“Looie496”/Wikimedia Commons, based on original work by Korvinian Brodmann)

Area 17, as Brodmann described it, is also known as the primary visual cortex. Adjacent to that are areas 18 and 19,
which constitute subsequent regions of visual processing. Area 22 is the primary auditory cortex, and it is followed by
area 23, which further processes auditory information. Area 4 is the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus, whereas
area 6 is the premotor cortex. These areas suggest some specialization within the cortex for functional processing, both in
sensory and motor regions. The fact that Brodmann’s areas correlate so closely to functional localization in the cerebral
cortex demonstrates the strong link between structure and function in these regions.

Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, and 22 are each described as primary cortical areas. The adjoining regions are each referred to
as association areas. Primary areas are where sensory information is initially received from the thalamus for conscious
perception, or—in the case of the primary motor cortex—where descending commands are sent down to the brain stem or
spinal cord to execute movements (Figure 16.5).

Figure 16.5 Types of Cortical Areas The cerebral cortex can be described as containing three types of processing
regions: primary, association, and integration areas. The primary cortical areas are where sensory information is
initially processed, or where motor commands emerge to go to the brain stem or spinal cord. Association areas are
adjacent to primary areas and further process the modality-specific input. Multimodal integration areas are found where
the modality-specific regions meet; they can process multiple modalities together or different modalities on the basis of
similar functions, such as spatial processing in vision or somatosensation.

654 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

A number of other regions, which extend beyond these primary or association areas of the cortex, are referred to as
integrative areas. These areas are found in the spaces between the domains for particular sensory or motor functions, and
they integrate multisensory information, or process sensory or motor information in more complex ways. Consider, for
example, the posterior parietal cortex that lies between the somatosensory cortex and visual cortex regions. This has been
ascribed to the coordination of visual and motor functions, such as reaching to pick up a glass. The somatosensory function
that would be part of this is the proprioceptive feedback from moving the arm and hand. The weight of the glass, based on
what it contains, will influence how those movements are executed.

Cognitive Abilities

Assessment of cerebral functions is directed at cognitive abilities. The abilities assessed through the mental status exam
can be separated into four groups: orientation and memory, language and speech, sensorium, and judgment and abstract
reasoning.

Orientation and Memory

Orientation is the patient’s awareness of his or her immediate circumstances. It is awareness of time, not in terms of the
clock, but of the date and what is occurring around the patient. It is awareness of place, such that a patient should know
where he or she is and why. It is also awareness of who the patient is—recognizing personal identity and being able to relate
that to the examiner. The initial tests of orientation are based on the questions, “Do you know what the date is?” or “Do
you know where you are?” or “What is your name?” Further understanding of a patient’s awareness of orientation can come
from questions that address remote memory, such as “Who is the President of the United States?”, or asking what happened
on a specific date.
There are also specific tasks to address memory. One is the three-word recall test. The patient is given three words to
recall, such as book, clock, and shovel. After a short interval, during which other parts of the interview continue, the patient
is asked to recall the three words. Other tasks that assess memory—aside from those related to orientation—have the patient
recite the months of the year in reverse order to avoid the overlearned sequence and focus on the memory of the months in
an order, or to spell common words backwards, or to recite a list of numbers back.

Memory is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along with structures beneath the cerebral cortex such as the
hippocampus and the amygdala. The storage of memory requires these structures of the medial temporal lobe. A famous
case of a man who had both medial temporal lobes removed to treat intractable epilepsy provided insight into the
relationship between the structures of the brain and the function of memory.

Henry Molaison, who was referred to as patient HM when he was alive, had epilepsy localized to both of his medial
temporal lobes. In 1953, a bilateral lobectomy was performed that alleviated the epilepsy but resulted in the inability for
HM to form new memories—a condition called anterograde amnesia. HM was able to recall most events from before his
surgery, although there was a partial loss of earlier memories, which is referred to as retrograde amnesia. HM became the
subject of extensive studies into how memory works. What he was unable to do was form new memories of what happened
to him, what are now called episodic memory. Episodic memory is autobiographical in nature, such as remembering riding
a bicycle as a child around the neighborhood, as opposed to the procedural memory of how to ride a bike. HM also retained
his short-term memory, such as what is tested by the three-word task described above. After a brief period, those memories
would dissipate or decay and not be stored in the long-term because the medial temporal lobe structures were removed.
The difference in short-term, procedural, and episodic memory, as evidenced by patient HM, suggests that there
are different parts of the brain responsible for those functions. The long-term storage of episodic memory requires the
hippocampus and related medial temporal structures, and the location of those memories is in the multimodal integration
areas of the cerebral cortex. However, short-term memory—also called working or active memory—is localized to the
prefrontal lobe. Because patient HM had only lost his medial temporal lobe—and lost very little of his previous memories,
and did not lose the ability to form new short-term memories—it was concluded that the function of the hippocampus, and
adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe, is to move (or consolidate) short-term memories (in the pre-frontal lobe) to
long-term memory (in the temporal lobe).

The prefrontal cortex can also be tested for the ability to organize information. In one subtest of the mental status exam
called set generation, the patient is asked to generate a list of words that all start with the same letter, but not to include
proper nouns or names. The expectation is that a person can generate such a list of at least 10 words within 1 minute. Many
people can likely do this much more quickly, but the standard separates the accepted normal from those with compromised
prefrontal cortices.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 655

©- Interactive |LINK

Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/3word) to learn about a young man who texts his fiancée in a panic
as he finds that he is having trouble remembering things. At the hospital, a neurologist administers the mental status
exam, which is mostly normal except for the three-word recall test. The young man could not recall them even 30
seconds after hearing them and repeating them back to the doctor. An undiscovered mass in the mediastinum region
was found to be Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system and likely caused antibodies to
attack the nervous system. The patient eventually regained his ability to remember, though the events in the hospital
were always elusive. Considering that the effects on memory were temporary, but resulted in the loss of the specific
events of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely to have been affected by the antibodies and what type
of memory does that represent?

Language and Speech

Language is, arguably, a very human aspect of neurological function. There are certainly strides being made in
understanding communication in other species, but much of what makes the human experience seemingly unique is its basis
in language. Any understanding of our species is necessarily reflective, as suggested by the question “What am I?” And the
fundamental answer to this question is suggested by the famous quote by René Descartes: “Cogito Ergo Sum” (translated
from Latin as “I think, therefore | am”). Formulating an understanding of yourself is largely describing who you are to
yourself. It is a confusing topic to delve into, but language is certainly at the core of what it means to be self-aware.

The neurological exam has two specific subtests that address language. One measures the ability of the patient to
understand language by asking them to follow a set of instructions to perform an action, such as “touch your right finger
to your left elbow and then to your right knee.” Another subtest assesses the fluency and coherency of language by having
the patient generate descriptions of objects or scenes depicted in drawings, and by reciting sentences or explaining a written
passage. Language, however, is important in so many ways in the neurological exam. The patient needs to know what to do,
whether it is as simple as explaining how the knee-jerk reflex is going to be performed, or asking a question such as “What
is your name?” Often, language deficits can be determined without specific subtests; if a person cannot reply to a question
properly, there may be a problem with the reception of language.

An important example of multimodal integrative areas is associated with language function (Figure 16.6). Adjacent
to the auditory association cortex, at the end of the lateral sulcus just anterior to the visual cortex, is Wernicke’s area. In
the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe, just anterior to the region of the motor cortex associated with the head and neck, is
Broca’s area. Both regions were originally described on the basis of losses of speech and language, which is called aphasia.
The aphasia associated with Broca’s area is known as an expressive aphasia, which means that speech production is
compromised. This type of aphasia is often described as non-fluency because the ability to say some words leads to broken
or halting speech. Grammar can also appear to be lost. The aphasia associated with Wernicke’s area is known as a receptive
aphasia, which is not a loss of speech production, but a loss of understanding of content. Patients, after recovering from
acute forms of this aphasia, report not being able to understand what is said to them or what they are saying themselves, but
they often cannot keep from talking.

The two regions are connected by white matter tracts that run between the posterior temporal lobe and the lateral aspect
of the frontal lobe. Conduction aphasia associated with damage to this connection refers to the problem of connecting the
understanding of language to the production of speech. This is a very rare condition, but is likely to present as an inability
to faithfully repeat spoken language.

Broca's area Wernicke's area

Figure 16.6 Broca's and Wernicke's Areas Two important integration areas of the cerebral cortex associated with
language function are Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. The two areas are connected through the deep white matter
running from the posterior temporal lobe to the frontal lobe.

Sensorium

Those parts of the brain involved in the reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli are referred to collectively as the
sensorium. The cerebral cortex has several regions that are necessary for sensory perception. From the primary cortical
areas of the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and gustatory senses to the association areas that process information in these
modalities, the cerebral cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception. In contrast, sensory information can also be
processed by deeper brain regions, which we may vaguely describe as subconscious—for instance, we are not constantly
aware of the proprioceptive information that the cerebellum uses to maintain balance. Several of the subtests can reveal
activity associated with these sensory modalities, such as being able to hear a question or see a picture. Two subtests assess
specific functions of these cortical areas.
The first is praxis, a practical exercise in which the patient performs a task completely on the basis of verbal
description without any demonstration from the examiner. For example, the patient can be told to take their left hand and
place it palm down on their left thigh, then flip it over so the palm is facing up, and then repeat this four times. The
examiner describes the activity without any movements on their part to suggest how the movements are to be performed.
The patient needs to understand the instructions, transform them into movements, and use sensory feedback, both visua
and proprioceptive, to perform the movements correctly.
The second subtest for sensory perception is gnosis, which involves two tasks. The first task, known as stereognosis,
nvolves the naming of objects strictly on the basis of the somatosensory information that comes from manipulating them.
[he patient keeps their eyes closed and is given a common object, such as a coin, that they have to identify. The patient
should be able to indicate the particular type of coin, such as a dime versus a penny, or a nickel versus a quarter, on the basis
of the sensory cues involved. For example, the size, thickness, or weight of the coin may be an indication, or to differentiate
the pairs of coins suggested here, the smooth or corrugated edge of the coin will correspond to the particular denomination.
The second task, graphesthesia, is to recognize numbers or letters written on the palm of the hand with a dull pointer, such
as a pen cap.
Praxis and gnosis are related to the conscious perception and cortical processing of sensory information. Being able
to transform verbal commands into a sequence of motor responses, or to manipulate and recognize a common object and
associate it with a name for that object. Both subtests have language components because language function is integral
to these functions. The relationship between the words that describe actions, or the nouns that represent objects, and
the cerebral location of these concepts is suggested to be localized to particular cortical areas. Certain aphasias can be
characterized by a deficit of verbs or nouns, known as V impairment or N impairment, or may be classified as V-N
dissociation. Patients have difficulty using one type of word over the other. To describe what is happening in a photograph
as part of the expressive language subtest, a patient will use active- or image-based language. The lack of one or the other
of these components of language can relate to the ability to use verbs or nouns. Damage to the region at which the frontal
and temporal lobes meet, including the region known as the insula, is associated with V impairment; damage to the middle
and inferior temporal lobe is associated with N impairment.

Judgment and Abstract Reasoning

Planning and producing responses requires an ability to make sense of the world around us. Making judgments and
reasoning in the abstract are necessary to produce movements as part of larger responses. For example, when your alarm
goes off, do you hit the snooze button or jump out of bed? Is 10 extra minutes in bed worth the extra rush to get ready for

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 657

your day? Will hitting the snooze button multiple times lead to feeling more rested or result in a panic as you run late? How
you mentally process these questions can affect your whole day.

The prefrontal cortex is responsible for the functions responsible for planning and making decisions. In the mental
status exam, the subtest that assesses judgment and reasoning is directed at three aspects of frontal lobe function. First, the
examiner asks questions about problem solving, such as “If you see a house on fire, what would you do?” The patient is
also asked to interpret common proverbs, such as “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” Additionally, pairs of words are
compared for similarities, such as apple and orange, or lamp and cabinet.

The prefrontal cortex is composed of the regions of the frontal lobe that are not directly related to specific motor
functions. The most posterior region of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus, is the primary motor cortex. Anterior to that are
the premotor cortex, Broca’s area, and the frontal eye fields, which are all related to planning certain types of movements.
Anterior to what could be described as motor association areas are the regions of the prefrontal cortex. They are the regions
in which judgment, abstract reasoning, and working memory are localized. The antecedents to planning certain movements
are judging whether those movements should be made, as in the example of deciding whether to hit the snooze button.

To an extent, the prefrontal cortex may be related to personality. The neurological exam does not necessarily assess
personality, but it can be within the realm of neurology or psychiatry. A clinical situation that suggests this link between
the prefrontal cortex and personality comes from the story of Phineas Gage, the railroad worker from the mid-1800s who
had a metal spike impale his prefrontal cortex. There are suggestions that the steel rod led to changes in his personality. A
man who was a quiet, dependable railroad worker became a raucous, irritable drunkard. Later anecdotal evidence from his
life suggests that he was able to support himself, although he had to relocate and take on a different career as a stagecoach
driver.

A psychiatric practice to deal with various disorders was the prefrontal lobotomy. This procedure was common in
the 1940s and early 1950s, until antipsychotic drugs became available. The connections between the prefrontal cortex and
other regions of the brain were severed. The disorders associated with this procedure included some aspects of what are
now referred to as personality disorders, but also included mood disorders and psychoses. Depictions of lobotomies in
popular media suggest a link between cutting the white matter of the prefrontal cortex and changes in a patient’s mood and
personality, though this correlation is not well understood.

Everyday CONNECTION

Left Brain, Right Brain

Popular media often refer to right-brained and left-brained people, as if the brain were two independent halves that
work differently for different people. This is a popular misinterpretation of an important neurological phenomenon. As
an extreme measure to deal with a debilitating condition, the corpus callosum may be sectioned to overcome intractable
epilepsy. When the connections between the two cerebral hemispheres are cut, interesting effects can be observed.

If a person with an intact corpus callosum is asked to put their hands in their pockets and describe what is there
on the basis of what their hands feel, they might say that they have keys in their right pocket and loose change in the
left. They may even be able to count the coins in their pocket and say if they can afford to buy a candy bar from the
vending machine. If a person with a sectioned corpus callosum is given the same instructions, they will do something
quite peculiar. They will only put their right hand in their pocket and say they have keys there. They will not even
move their left hand, much less report that there is loose change in the left pocket.

The reason for this is that the language functions of the cerebral cortex are localized to the left hemisphere in
95 percent of the population. Additionally, the left hemisphere is connected to the right side of the body through the
corticospinal tract and the ascending tracts of the spinal cord. Motor commands from the precentral gyrus control the
opposite side of the body, whereas sensory information processed by the postcentral gyrus is received from the opposite
side of the body. For a verbal command to initiate movement of the right arm and hand, the left side of the brain needs
to be connected by the corpus callosum. Language is processed in the left side of the brain and directly influences the
left brain and right arm motor functions, but is sent to influence the right brain and left arm motor functions through
the corpus callosum. Likewise, the left-handed sensory perception of what is in the left pocket travels across the corpus
callosum from the right brain, so no verbal report on those contents would be possible if the hand happened to be in
the pocket.

Watch the video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2brains) titled “The Man With Two Brains” to see the neuroscientist
Michael Gazzaniga introduce a patient he has worked with for years who has had his corpus callosum cut, separating
his two cerebral hemispheres. A few tests are run to demonstrate how this manifests in tests of cerebral function. Unlike
normal people, this patient can perform two independent tasks at the same time because the lines of communication
between the right and left sides of his brain have been removed. Whereas a person with an intact corpus callosum
cannot overcome the dominance of one hemisphere over the other, this patient can. If the left cerebral hemisphere is
dominant in the majority of people, why would right-handedness be most common?

The Mental Status Exam

The cerebrum, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the location of important cognitive functions that are the focus of
the mental status exam. The regionalization of the cortex, initially described on the basis of anatomical evidence of
cytoarchitecture, reveals the distribution of functionally distinct areas. Cortical regions can be described as primary sensory
or motor areas, association areas, or multimodal integration areas. The functions attributed to these regions include attention,
memory, language, speech, sensation, judgment, and abstract reasoning.

The mental status exam addresses these cognitive abilities through a series of subtests designed to elicit particular
behaviors ascribed to these functions. The loss of neurological function can illustrate the location of damage to the
cerebrum. Memory functions are attributed to the temporal lobe, particularly the medial temporal lobe structures known as
the hippocampus and amygdala, along with the adjacent cortex. Evidence of the importance of these structures comes from
the side effects of a bilateral temporal lobectomy that were studied in detail in patient HM.

Losses of language and speech functions, known as aphasias, are associated with damage to the important integration
areas in the left hemisphere known as Broca’s or Wernicke’s areas, as well as the connections in the white matter between
them. Different types of aphasia are named for the particular structures that are damaged. Assessment of the functions of
the sensorium includes praxis and gnosis. The subtests related to these functions depend on multimodal integration, as well
as language-dependent processing.

The prefrontal cortex contains structures important for planning, judgment, reasoning, and working memory. Damage
to these areas can result in changes to personality, mood, and behavior. The famous case of Phineas Gage suggests a role
for this cortex in personality, as does the outdated practice of prefrontal lobectomy.

16.3 | The Cranial Nerve Exam

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the functional grouping of cranial nerves
* Match the regions of the forebrain and brain stem that are connected to each cranial nerve
¢ Suggest diagnoses that would explain certain losses of function in the cranial nerves
¢ Relate cranial nerve deficits to damage of adjacent, unrelated structures

The twelve cranial nerves are typically covered in introductory anatomy courses, and memorizing their names is facilitated
by numerous mnemonics developed by students over the years of this practice. But knowing the names of the nerves in
order often leaves much to be desired in understanding what the nerves do. The nerves can be categorized by functions, and
subtests of the cranial nerve exam can clarify these functional groupings.

Three of the nerves are strictly responsible for special senses whereas four others contain fibers for special and general
senses. Three nerves are connected to the extraocular muscles resulting in the control of gaze. Four nerves connect to
muscles of the face, oral cavity, and pharynx, controlling facial expressions, mastication, swallowing, and speech. Four
nerves make up the cranial component of the parasympathetic nervous system responsible for pupillary constriction,
salivation, and the regulation of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. Finally, one nerve controls the
muscles of the neck, assisting with spinal control of the movement of the head and neck.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 659

The cranial nerve exam allows directed tests of forebrain and brain stem structures. The twelve cranial nerves serve the
head and neck. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) has autonomic functions in the thoracic and superior abdominal cavities.
The special senses are served through the cranial nerves, as well as the general senses of the head and neck. The movement
of the eyes, face, tongue, throat, and neck are all under the control of cranial nerves. Preganglionic parasympathetic nerve
fibers that control pupillary size, salivary glands, and the thoracic and upper abdominal viscera are found in four of the
nerves. Tests of these functions can provide insight into damage to specific regions of the brain stem and may uncover
deficits in adjacent regions.

Sensory Nerves

The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves (cranial nerves I, II, and VIII) are dedicated to four of the special senses:
smell, vision, equilibrium, and hearing, respectively. Taste sensation is relayed to the brain stem through fibers of the facial
and glossopharyngeal nerves. The trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve that carries the general somatic senses from the head,
similar to those coming through spinal nerves from the rest of the body.
Testing smell is straightforward, as common smells are presented to one nostril at a time. The patient should be able to
recognize the smell of coffee or mint, indicating the proper functioning of the olfactory system. Loss of the sense of smell is
called anosmia and can be lost following blunt trauma to the head or through aging. The short axons of the first cranial nerve
regenerate on a regular basis. The neurons in the olfactory epithelium have a limited life span, and new cells grow to replace
the ones that die off. The axons from these neurons grow back into the CNS by following the existing axons—representing
one of the few examples of such growth in the mature nervous system. If all of the fibers are sheared when the brain moves
within the cranium, such as in a motor vehicle accident, then no axons can find their way back to the olfactory bulb to re-
establish connections. If the nerve is not completely severed, the anosmia may be temporary as new neurons can eventually
reconnect.
Olfaction is not the pre-eminent sense, but its loss can be quite detrimental. The enjoyment of food is largely based on
our sense of smell. Anosmia means that food will not seem to have the same taste, though the gustatory sense is intact, and
food will often be described as being bland. However, the taste of food can be improved by adding ingredients (e.g., salt)
that stimulate the gustatory sense.
Testing vision relies on the tests that are common in an optometry office. The Snellen chart (Figure 16.7)
demonstrates visual acuity by presenting standard Roman letters in a variety of sizes. The result of this test is a rough
generalization of the acuity of a person based on the normal accepted acuity, such that a letter that subtends a visual angle
of 5 minutes of an arc at 20 feet can be seen. To have 20/60 vision, for example, means that the smallest letters that a person
can see at a 20-foot distance could be seen by a person with normal acuity from 60 feet away. Testing the extent of the visual
field means that the examiner can establish the boundaries of peripheral vision as simply as holding their hands out to either
side and asking the patient when the fingers are no longer visible without moving the eyes to track them. If it is necessary,
further tests can establish the perceptions in the visual fields. Physical inspection of the optic disk, or where the optic nerve
emerges from the eye, can be accomplished by looking through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.

that a person with normal acuity should be able to read at that distance. The different sizes of letters in the other lines
represent rough approximations of what a person of normal acuity can read at different distances. For example, the
line that represents 20/200 vision would have larger letters so that they are legible to the person with normal acuity at
200 feet.

The optic nerves from both sides enter the cranium through the respective optic canals and meet at the optic chiasm
at which fibers sort such that the two halves of the visual field are processed by the opposite sides of the brain. Deficits in
visual field perception often suggest damage along the length of the optic pathway between the orbit and the diencephalon.
For example, loss of peripheral vision may be the result of a pituitary tumor pressing on the optic chiasm (Figure 16.8). The
pituitary, seated in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, is directly inferior to the optic chiasm. The axons that decussate
in the chiasm are from the medial retinae of either eye, and therefore carry information from the peripheral visual field.

Figure 16.8 Pituitary Tumor The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone within the cranial
floor, placing it immediately inferior to the optic chiasm. If the pituitary gland develops a tumor, it can press against the
fibers crossing in the chiasm. Those fibers are conveying peripheral visual information to the opposite side of the brain,
so the patient will experience “tunnel vision’—meaning that only the central visual field will be perceived.

The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries both equilibrium and auditory sensations from the inner ear to the
medulla. Though the two senses are not directly related, anatomy is mirrored in the two systems. Problems with balance,
such as vertigo, and deficits in hearing may both point to problems with the inner ear. Within the petrous region of the
temporal bone is the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. The vestibule is the portion for equilibrium, composed of the utricle,
saccule, and the three semicircular canals. The cochlea is responsible for transducing sound waves into a neural signal. The
sensory nerves from these two structures travel side-by-side as the vestibulocochlear nerve, though they are really separate
divisions. They both emerge from the inner ear, pass through the internal auditory meatus, and synapse in nuclei of the
superior medulla. Though they are part of distinct sensory systems, the vestibular nuclei and the cochlear nuclei are close
neighbors with adjacent inputs. Deficits in one or both systems could occur from damage that encompasses structures close
to both. Damage to structures near the two nuclei can result in deficits to one or both systems.

Balance or hearing deficits may be the result of damage to the middle or inner ear structures. Méniére's disease is
a disorder that can affect both equilibrium and audition in a variety of ways. The patient can suffer from vertigo, a low-
frequency ringing in the ears, or a loss of hearing. From patient to patient, the exact presentation of the disease can be
different. Additionally, within a single patient, the symptoms and signs may change as the disease progresses. Use of the
neurological exam subtests for the vestibulocochlear nerve illuminates the changes a patient may go through. The disease
appears to be the result of accumulation, or over-production, of fluid in the inner ear, in either the vestibule or cochlea.

Tests of equilibrium are important for coordination and gait and are related to other aspects of the neurological exam.
The vestibulo-ocular reflex involves the cranial nerves for gaze control. Balance and equilibrium, as tested by the Romberg
test, are part of spinal and cerebellar processes and involved in those components of the neurological exam, as discussed
later.

Hearing is tested by using a tuning fork in a couple of different ways. The Rinne test involves using a tuning fork
to distinguish between conductive hearing and sensorineural hearing. Conductive hearing relies on vibrations being
conducted through the ossicles of the middle ear. Sensorineural hearing is the transmission of sound stimuli through the
neural components of the inner ear and cranial nerve. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and the
patient indicates when the sound produced from this is no longer present. Then the fork is immediately moved to just next to
the ear canal so the sound travels through the air. If the sound is not heard through the ear, meaning the sound is conducted
better through the temporal bone than through the ossicles, a conductive hearing deficit is present. The Weber test also uses
a tuning fork to differentiate between conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss. In this test, the tuning fork is placed at
the top of the skull, and the sound of the tuning fork reaches both inner ears by travelling through bone. In a healthy patient,
the sound would appear equally loud in both ears. With unilateral conductive hearing loss, however, the tuning fork sounds
louder in the ear with hearing loss. This is because the sound of the tuning fork has to compete with background noise
coming from the outer ear, but in conductive hearing loss, the background noise is blocked in the damaged ear, allowing the
tuning fork to sound relatively louder in that ear. With unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, however, damage to the cochlea
or associated nervous tissue means that the tuning fork sounds quieter in that ear.

The trigeminal system of the head and neck is the equivalent of the ascending spinal cord systems of the dorsal column
and the spinothalamic pathways. Somatosensation of the face is conveyed along the nerve to enter the brain stem at the
level of the pons. Synapses of those axons, however, are distributed across nuclei found throughout the brain stem. The
mesencephalic nucleus processes proprioceptive information of the face, which is the movement and position of facial
muscles. It is the sensory component of the jaw-jerk reflex, a stretch reflex of the masseter muscle. The chief nucleus,
located in the pons, receives information about light touch as well as proprioceptive information about the mandible, which
are both relayed to the thalamus and, ultimately, to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe. The spinal trigeminal nucleus,
located in the medulla, receives information about crude touch, pain, and temperature to be relayed to the thalamus and


662 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

cortex. Essentially, the projection through the chief nucleus is analogous to the dorsal column pathway for the body, and the
projection through the spinal trigeminal nucleus is analogous to the spinothalamic pathway.

Subtests for the sensory component of the trigeminal system are the same as those for the sensory exam targeting the
spinal nerves. The primary sensory subtest for the trigeminal system is sensory discrimination. A cotton-tipped applicator,
which is cotton attached to the end of a thin wooden stick, can be used easily for this. The wood of the applicator can be
snapped so that a pointed end is opposite the soft cotton-tipped end. The cotton end provides a touch stimulus, while the
pointed end provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus. While the patient’s eyes are closed, the examiner touches the two ends
of the applicator to the patient’s face, alternating randomly between them. The patient must identify whether the stimulus is
sharp or dull. These stimuli are processed by the trigeminal system separately. Contact with the cotton tip of the applicator
is a light touch, relayed by the chief nucleus, but contact with the pointed end of the applicator is a painful stimulus relayed
by the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Failure to discriminate these stimuli can localize problems within the brain stem. If a
patient cannot recognize a painful stimulus, that might indicate damage to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla. The
medulla also contains important regions that regulate the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems, as well as being
the pathway for ascending and descending tracts between the brain and spinal cord. Damage, such as a stroke, that results
in changes in sensory discrimination may indicate these unrelated regions are affected as well.

Gaze Control

The three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which are the
third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. As the name suggests, the abducens nerve is responsible for abducting the eye, which
it controls through contraction of the lateral rectus muscle. The trochlear nerve controls the superior oblique muscle to rotate
the eye along its axis in the orbit medially, which is called intorsion, and is a component of focusing the eyes on an object
close to the face. The oculomotor nerve controls all the other extraocular muscles, as well as a muscle of the upper eyelid.
Movements of the two eyes need to be coordinated to locate and track visual stimuli accurately. When moving the eyes
to locate an object in the horizontal plane, or to track movement horizontally in the visual field, the lateral rectus muscle
of one eye and medial rectus muscle of the other eye are both active. The lateral rectus is controlled by neurons of the
abducens nucleus in the superior medulla, whereas the medial rectus is controlled by neurons in the oculomotor nucleus of
the midbrain.

Coordinated movement of both eyes through different nuclei requires integrated processing through the brain stem.
In the midbrain, the superior colliculus integrates visual stimuli with motor responses to initiate eye movements. The
paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) will initiate a rapid eye movement, or saccade, to bring the eyes to bear
on a visual stimulus quickly. These areas are connected to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei by the medial
longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) that runs through the majority of the brain stem. The MLF allows for conjugate gaze, or
the movement of the eyes in the same direction, during horizontal movements that require the lateral and medial rectus
muscles. Control of conjugate gaze strictly in the vertical direction is contained within the oculomotor complex. To elevate
the eyes, the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both superior rectus muscles; to depress the eyes,
the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both inferior rectus muscles.

Purely vertical movements of the eyes are not very common. Movements are often at an angle, so some horizontal
components are necessary, adding the medial and lateral rectus muscles to the movement. The rapid movement of the eyes
used to locate and direct the fovea onto visual stimuli is called a saccade. Notice that the paths that are traced in Figure 16.9
are not strictly vertical. The movements between the nose and the mouth are closest, but still have a slant to them. Also, the
superior and inferior rectus muscles are not perfectly oriented with the line of sight. The origin for both muscles is medial
to their insertions, so elevation and depression may require the lateral rectus muscles to compensate for the slight adduction
inherent in the contraction of those muscles, requiring MLF activity as well.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 663

Figure 16.9 Saccadic Eye Movements Saccades are rapid, conjugate movements of the eyes to survey a
complicated visual stimulus, or to follow a moving visual stimulus. This image represents the shifts in gaze typical of
a person studying a face. Notice the concentration of gaze on the major features of the face and the large number of
paths traced between the eyes or around the mouth.

Testing eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track the tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual
field. This may appear similar to testing visual field deficits related to the optic nerve, but the difference is that the patient
is asked to not move the eyes while the examiner moves a stimulus into the peripheral visual field. Here, the extent of
movement is the point of the test. The examiner is watching for conjugate movements representing proper function of the
related nuclei and the MLF. Failure of one eye to abduct while the other adducts in a horizontal movement is referred to
as internuclear ophthalmoplegia. When this occurs, the patient will experience diplopia, or double vision, as the two
eyes are temporarily pointed at different stimuli. Diplopia is not restricted to failure of the lateral rectus, because any of the
extraocular muscles may fail to move one eye in perfect conjugation with the other.

The final aspect of testing eye movements is to move the tip of the pen in toward the patient’s face. As visual stimuli
move closer to the face, the two medial recti muscles cause the eyes to move in the one nonconjugate movement that is part
of gaze control. When the two eyes move to look at something closer to the face, they both adduct, which is referred to as
convergence. To keep the stimulus in focus, the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens, which is controlled through
the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve. The change in focal power of the eye is referred to as accommodation.
Accommodation ability changes with age; focusing on nearer objects, such as the written text of a book or on a computer
screen, may require corrective lenses later in life. Coordination of the skeletal muscles for convergence and coordination of
the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are referred to as the accommodation—convergence reflex.

A crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of the retina. The vestibulo-
ocular reflex (VOR) coordinates all of the components (Figure 16.10), both sensory and motor, that make this possible.
If the head rotates in one direction—for example, to the right—the horizontal pair of semicircular canals in the inner ear
indicate the movement by increased activity on the right and decreased activity on the left. The information is sent to the
abducens nuclei and oculomotor nuclei on either side to coordinate the lateral and medial rectus muscles. The left lateral
rectus and right medial rectus muscles will contract, rotating the eyes in the opposite direction of the head, while nuclei
controlling the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles will be inhibited to reduce antagonism of the contracting
muscles. These actions stabilize the visual field by compensating for the head rotation with opposite rotation of the eyes in
the orbits. Deficits in the VOR may be related to vestibular damage, such as in Méniére’s disease, or from dorsal brain stem
damage that would affect the eye movement nuclei or their connections through the MLF.

Nerves of the Face and Oral Cavity

An iconic part of a doctor’s visit is the inspection of the oral cavity and pharynx, suggested by the directive to “open your
mouth and say ‘ah.’” This is followed by inspection, with the aid of a tongue depressor, of the back of the mouth, or the
opening of the oral cavity into the pharynx known as the fauces. Whereas this portion of a medical exam inspects for signs
of infection, such as in tonsillitis, it is also the means to test the functions of the cranial nerves that are associated with the
oral cavity.

The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the brain. Testing this is as simple as
introducing salty, sour, bitter, or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue. The patient should respond to the taste stimulus
before retracting the tongue into the mouth. Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve into the saliva
and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the left or right of the nerves, masking any lateral deficits. Along with
taste, the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the pharyngeal walls. These sensations, along with certain
taste stimuli, can stimulate the gag reflex. If the examiner moves the tongue depressor to contact the lateral wall of the
fauces, this should elicit the gag reflex. Stimulation of either side of the fauces should elicit an equivalent response. The
motor response, through contraction of the muscles of the pharynx, is mediated through the vagus nerve. Normally, the
vagus nerve is considered autonomic in nature. The vagus nerve directly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in
the pharynx and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and speech functions. Further testing of vagus motor function has
the patient repeating consonant sounds that require movement of the muscles around the fauces. The patient is asked to
say “lah-kah-pah” or a similar set of alternating sounds while the examiner observes the movements of the soft palate and
arches between the palate and tongue.

The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are also responsible for the initiation of salivation. Neurons in the salivary
nuclei of the medulla project through these two nerves as preganglionic fibers, and synapse in ganglia located in the head.
The parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, which projects to the submandibular
gland and sublingual gland. The parasympathetic fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion, which
projects to the parotid gland. Salivation in response to food in the oral cavity is based on a visceral reflex arc within the

facial or glossopharyngeal nerves. Other stimuli that stimulate salivation are coordinated through the hypothalamus, such
as the smell and sight of food.

The hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that controls the muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus muscle,
which is controlled by the vagus nerve. There are two sets of muscles of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue
are connected to other structures, whereas the intrinsic muscles of the tongue are completely contained within the lingual
tissues. While examining the oral cavity, movement of the tongue will indicate whether hypoglossal function is impaired.
The test for hypoglossal function is the “stick out your tongue” part of the exam. The genioglossus muscle is responsible
for protrusion of the tongue. If the hypoglossal nerves on both sides are working properly, then the tongue will stick straight
out. If the nerve on one side has a deficit, the tongue will stick out to that side—pointing to the side with damage. Loss
of function of the tongue can interfere with speech and swallowing. Additionally, because the location of the hypoglossal
nerve and nucleus is near the cardiovascular center, inspiratory and expiratory areas for respiration, and the vagus nuclei
that regulate digestive functions, a tongue that protrudes incorrectly can suggest damage in adjacent structures that have
nothing to do with controlling the tongue.

Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/facialnerve) to see an examination of the facial nerve using some
simple tests. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression. Severe deficits will be obvious in watching
someone use those muscles for normal control. One side of the face might not move like the other side. But directed
tests, especially for contraction against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles. The muscles of the upper
and lower face need to be tested. The strength test in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut and the
examiner trying to pry her eyes open. Why does the examiner ask her to try a second time?

Motor Nerves of the Neck

The accessory nerve, also referred to as the spinal accessory nerve, innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius
muscles (Figure 16.11). When both the sternocleidomastoids contract, the head flexes forward; individually, they cause
rotation to the opposite side. The trapezius can act as an antagonist, causing extension and hyperextension of the neck.
These two superficial muscles are important for changing the position of the head. Both muscles also receive input from
cervical spinal nerves. Along with the spinal accessory nerve, these nerves contribute to elevating the scapula and clavicle
through the trapezius, which is tested by asking the patient to shrug both shoulders, and watching for asymmetry. For the
sternocleidomastoid, those spinal nerves are primarily sensory projections, whereas the trapezius also has lateral insertions
to the clavicle and scapula, and receives motor input from the spinal cord. Calling the nerve the spinal accessory nerve
suggests that it is aiding the spinal nerves. Though that is not precisely how the name originated, it does help make the
association between the function of this nerve in controlling these muscles and the role these muscles play in movements of
the trunk or shoulders.

and trapezius muscles, both of which attach to the head and to the trunk and shoulders. They can act as antagonists
in head flexion and extension, and as synergists in lateral flexion toward the shoulder.

To test these muscles, the patient is asked to flex and extend the neck or shrug the shoulders against resistance, testing
the strength of the muscles. Lateral flexion of the neck toward the shoulder tests both at the same time. Any difference
on one side versus the other would suggest damage on the weaker side. These strength tests are common for the skeletal
muscles controlled by spinal nerves and are a significant component of the motor exam. Deficits associated with the
accessory nerve may have an effect on orienting the head, as described with the VOR.

Homeostatic ud BALANCES
The Pupillary Light Response

The autonomic control of pupillary size in response to a bright light involves the sensory input of the optic nerve
and the parasympathetic motor output of the oculomotor nerve. When light hits the retina, specialized photosensitive
ganglion cells send a signal along the optic nerve to the pretectal nucleus in the superior midbrain. A neuron from this
nucleus projects to the Eddinger—Westphal nuclei in the oculomotor complex in both sides of the midbrain. Neurons
in this nucleus give rise to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that project through the oculomotor nerve to the
ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ganglion project to the iris,
where they release acetylcholine onto circular fibers that constrict the pupil to reduce the amount of light hitting the
retina. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for dilating the pupil when light levels are low.

Shining light in one eye will elicit constriction of both pupils. The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex
is bilateral. Light shined in one eye causes a constriction of that pupil, as well as constriction of the contralateral
pupil. Shining a penlight in the eye of a patient is a very artificial situation, as both eyes are normally exposed to the
same light sources. Testing this reflex can illustrate whether the optic nerve or the oculomotor nerve is damaged. If
shining the light in one eye results in no changes in pupillary size but shining light in the opposite eye elicits a normal,
bilateral response, the damage is associated with the optic nerve on the nonresponsive side. If light in either eye elicits
a response in only one eye, the problem is with the oculomotor system.

If light in the right eye only causes the left pupil to constrict, the direct reflex is lost and the consensual reflex is
intact, which means that the right oculomotor nerve (or Eddinger—Westphal nucleus) is damaged. Damage to the right
oculomotor connections will be evident when light is shined in the left eye. In that case, the direct reflex is intact but
the consensual reflex is lost, meaning that the left pupil will constrict while the right does not.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 667

The Cranial Nerve Exam

The cranial nerves can be separated into four major groups associated with the subtests of the cranial nerve exam. First are
the sensory nerves, then the nerves that control eye movement, the nerves of the oral cavity and superior pharynx, and the
nerve that controls movements of the neck.
The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves are strictly sensory nerves for smell, sight, and balance and hearing,
whereas the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves carry somatosensation of the face, and taste—separated
between the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the posterior one-third. Special senses are tested by presenting the
particular stimuli to each receptive organ. General senses can be tested through sensory discrimination of touch versus
painful stimuli.
The oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves control the extraocular muscles and are connected by the medial
longitudinal fasciculus to coordinate gaze. Testing conjugate gaze is as simple as having the patient follow a visual target,
like a pen tip, through the visual field ending with an approach toward the face to test convergence and accommodation.
Along with the vestibular functions of the eighth nerve, the vestibulo-ocular reflex stabilizes gaze during head movements
by coordinating equilibrium sensations with the eye movement systems.
The trigeminal nerve controls the muscles of chewing, which are tested for stretch reflexes. Motor functions of the
acial nerve are usually obvious if facial expressions are compromised, but can be tested by having the patient raise their
eyebrows, smile, and frown. Movements of the tongue, soft palate, or superior pharynx can be observed directly while
the patient swallows, while the gag reflex is elicited, or while the patient says repetitive consonant sounds. The motor
control of the gag reflex is largely controlled by fibers in the vagus nerve and constitutes a test of that nerve because the
parasympathetic functions of that nerve are involved in visceral regulation, such as regulating the heartbeat and digestion.
Movement of the head and neck using the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles is controlled by the accessory
nerve. Flexing of the neck and strength testing of those muscles reviews the function of that nerve.

16.4 | The Sensory and Motor Exams

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the arrangement of sensory and motor regions in the spinal cord
¢ Relate damage in the spinal cord to sensory or motor deficits
¢ Differentiate between upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron diseases
* Describe the clinical indications of common reflexes

Connections between the body and the CNS occur through the spinal cord. The cranial nerves connect the head and neck
directly to the brain, but the spinal cord receives sensory input and sends motor commands out to the body through the spinal
nerves. Whereas the brain develops into a complex series of nuclei and fiber tracts, the spinal cord remains relatively simple
in its configuration (Figure 16.12). From the initial neural tube early in embryonic development, the spinal cord retains a
tube-like structure with gray matter surrounding the small central canal and white matter on the surface in three columns.
The dorsal, or posterior, horns of the gray matter are mainly devoted to sensory functions whereas the ventral, or anterior,
and lateral horns are associated with motor functions. In the white matter, the dorsal column relays sensory information to
the brain, and the anterior column is almost exclusively relaying motor commands to the ventral horn motor neurons. The
lateral column, however, conveys both sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and brain.

Sensory Modalities and Location

The general senses are distributed throughout the body, relying on nervous tissue incorporated into various organs. Somatic
senses are incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or tendons, whereas the visceral senses come from nervous tissue
incorporated into the majority of organs such as the heart or stomach. The somatic senses are those that usually make up
the conscious perception of the how the body interacts with the environment. The visceral senses are most often below the
limit of conscious perception because they are involved in homeostatic regulation through the autonomic nervous system.

The sensory exam tests the somatic senses, meaning those that are consciously perceived. Testing of the senses begins
with examining the regions known as dermatomes that connect to the cortical region where somatosensation is perceived
in the postcentral gyrus. To test the sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch of the soft end of a cotton-tipped
applicator is applied at various locations on the skin. The spinal nerves, which contain sensory fibers with dendritic endings
in the skin, connect with the skin in a topographically organized manner, illustrated as dermatomes (Figure 16.13). For
example, the fibers of eighth cervical nerve innervate the medial surface of the forearm and extend out to the fingers.
In addition to testing perception at different positions on the skin, it is necessary to test sensory perception within the
dermatome from distal to proximal locations in the appendages, or lateral to medial locations in the trunk. In testing the
eighth cervical nerve, the patient would be asked if the touch of the cotton to the fingers or the medial forearm was
perceptible, and whether there were any differences in the sensations.

Mikael Haggstr6m)

Other modalities of somatosensation can be tested using a few simple tools. The perception of pain can be tested
using the broken end of the cotton-tipped applicator. The perception of vibratory stimuli can be testing using an oscillating
tuning fork placed against prominent bone features such as the distal head of the ulna on the medial aspect of the elbow.
When the tuning fork is still, the metal against the skin can be perceived as a cold stimulus. Using the cotton tip of the
applicator, or even just a fingertip, the perception of tactile movement can be assessed as the stimulus is drawn across the
skin for approximately 2-3 cm. The patient would be asked in what direction the stimulus is moving. All of these tests are
repeated in distal and proximal locations and for different dermatomes to assess the spatial specificity of perception. The
sense of position and motion, proprioception, is tested by moving the fingers or toes and asking the patient if they sense the
movement. If the distal locations are not perceived, the test is repeated at increasingly proximal joints.

The various stimuli used to test sensory input assess the function of the major ascending tracts of the spinal cord.
The dorsal column pathway conveys fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive information, whereas the spinothalamic
pathway primarily conveys pain and temperature. Testing these stimuli provides information about whether these two major
ascending pathways are functioning properly. Within the spinal cord, the two systems are segregated. The dorsal column
information ascends ipsilateral to the source of the stimulus and decussates in the medulla, whereas the spinothalamic
pathway decussates at the level of entry and ascends contralaterally. The differing sensory stimuli are segregated in the
spinal cord so that the various subtests for these stimuli can distinguish which ascending pathway may be damaged in certain
situations.

670 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

Whereas the basic sensory stimuli are assessed in the subtests directed at each submodality of somatosensation, testing
the ability to discriminate sensations is important. Pairing the light touch and pain subtests together makes it possible to
compare the two submodalities at the same time, and therefore the two major ascending tracts at the same time. Mistaking
painful stimuli for light touch, or vice versa, may point to errors in ascending projections, such as in a hemisection of the
spinal cord that might come from a motor vehicle accident.

Another issue of sensory discrimination is not distinguishing between different submodalities, but rather location. The
two-point discrimination subtest highlights the density of sensory endings, and therefore receptive fields in the skin. The
sensitivity to fine touch, which can give indications of the texture and detailed shape of objects, is highest in the fingertips.
To assess the limit of this sensitivity, two-point discrimination is measured by simultaneously touching the skin in two
locations, such as could be accomplished with a pair of forceps. Specialized calipers for precisely measuring the distance
between points are also available. The patient is asked to indicate whether one or two stimuli are present while keeping their
eyes closed. The examiner will switch between using the two points and a single point as the stimulus. Failure to recognize
two points may be an indication of a dorsal column pathway deficit.

Similar to two-point discrimination, but assessing laterality of perception, is double simultaneous stimulation. Two
stimuli, such as the cotton tips of two applicators, are touched to the same position on both sides of the body. If one side is
not perceived, this may indicate damage to the contralateral posterior parietal lobe. Because there is one of each pathway
on either side of the spinal cord, they are not likely to interact. If none of the other subtests suggest particular deficits with
the pathways, the deficit is likely to be in the cortex where conscious perception is based. The mental status exam contains
subtests that assess other functions that are primarily localized to the parietal cortex, such as stereognosis and graphesthesia.

A final subtest of sensory perception that concentrates on the sense of proprioception is known as the Romberg test.
The patient is asked to stand straight with feet together. Once the patient has achieved their balance in that position, they
are asked to close their eyes. Without visual feedback that the body is in a vertical orientation relative to the surrounding
environment, the patient must rely on the proprioceptive stimuli of joint and muscle position, as well as information from the
inner ear, to maintain balance. This test can indicate deficits in dorsal column pathway proprioception, as well as problems
with proprioceptive projections to the cerebellum through the spinocerebellar tract.

©@- Interactive LINK

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2point) to see a quick demonstration of two-point discrimination.
Touching a specialized caliper to the surface of the skin will measure the distance between two points that are perceived
as distinct stimuli versus a single stimulus. The patient keeps their eyes closed while the examiner switches between
using both points of the caliper or just one. The patient then must indicate whether one or two stimuli are in contact
with the skin. Why is the distance between the caliper points closer on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the
hand? And what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the shoulder?

Muscle Strength and Voluntary Movement

The skeletomotor system is largely based on the simple, two-cell projection from the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe to
the skeletal muscles. The corticospinal tract represents the neurons that send output from the primary motor cortex. These
‘ibers travel through the deep white matter of the cerebrum, then through the midbrain and pons, into the medulla where
most of them decussate, and finally through the spinal cord white matter in the lateral (crossed fibers) or anterior (uncrossed
‘ibers) columns. These fibers synapse on motor neurons in the ventral horn. The ventral horn motor neurons then project
to skeletal muscle and cause contraction. These two cells are termed the upper motor neuron (UMN) and the lower motor
neuron (LMN). Voluntary movements require these two cells to be active.

The motor exam tests the function of these neurons and the muscles they control. First, the muscles are inspected and
palpated for signs of structural irregularities. Movement disorders may be the result of changes to the muscle tissue, such
as scarring, and these possibilities need to be ruled out before testing function. Along with this inspection, muscle tone
is assessed by moving the muscles through a passive range of motion. The arm is moved at the elbow and wrist, and the
leg is moved at the knee and ankle. Skeletal muscle should have a resting tension representing a slight contraction of the
‘ibers. The lack of muscle tone, known as hypotonicity or flaccidity, may indicate that the LMN is not conducting action
potentials that will keep a basal level of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 671

If muscle tone is present, muscle strength is tested by having the patient contract muscles against resistance. The
examiner will ask the patient to lift the arm, for example, while the examiner is pushing down on it. This is done for both
limbs, including shrugging the shoulders. Lateral differences in strength—being able to push against resistance with the
right arm but not the left—would indicate a deficit in one corticospinal tract versus the other. An overall loss of strength,
without laterality, could indicate a global problem with the motor system. Diseases that result in UMN lesions include
cerebral palsy or MS, or it may be the result of a stroke. A sign of UMN lesion is a negative result in the subtest for pronator
drift. The patient is asked to extend both arms in front of the body with the palms facing up. While keeping the eyes closed,
if the patient unconsciously allows one or the other arm to slowly relax, toward the pronated position, this could indicate a
failure of the motor system to maintain the supinated position.

Reflexes

Reflexes combine the spinal sensory and motor components with a sensory input that directly generates a motor response.
The reflexes that are tested in the neurological exam are classified into two groups. A deep tendon reflex is commonly
known as a stretch reflex, and is elicited by a strong tap to a tendon, such as in the knee-jerk reflex. A superficial reflex is
elicited through gentle stimulation of the skin and causes contraction of the associated muscles.
For the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the leg,
the knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex for the gastrocnemius and soleus. The tendon at the
insertion for each of these muscles is struck with a rubber mallet. The muscle is quickly stretched, resulting in activation of
the muscle spindle that sends a signal into the spinal cord through the dorsal root. The fiber synapses directly on the ventral
horn motor neuron that activates the muscle, causing contraction. The reflexes are physiologically useful for stability. If a
muscle is stretched, it reflexively contracts to return the muscle to compensate for the change in length. In the context of the
neurological exam, reflexes indicate that the LMN is functioning properly.
The most common superficial reflex in the neurological exam is the plantar reflex that tests for the Babinski sign on
the basis of the extension or flexion of the toes at the plantar surface of the foot. The plantar reflex is commonly tested in
newborn infants to establish the presence of neuromuscular function. To elicit this reflex, an examiner brushes a stimulus,
usually the examiner’s fingertip, along the plantar surface of the infant’s foot. An infant would present a positive Babinski
sign, meaning the foot dorsiflexes and the toes extend and splay out. As a person learns to walk, the plantar reflex changes
to cause curling of the toes and a moderate plantar flexion. If superficial stimulation of the sole of the foot caused extension
of the foot, keeping one’s balance would be harder. The descending input of the corticospinal tract modifies the response
of the plantar reflex, meaning that a negative Babinski sign is the expected response in testing the reflex. Other superficial
reflexes are not commonly tested, though a series of abdominal reflexes can target function in the lower thoracic spinal
segments.

©- Interactive |LINK

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/reflextest) to see how to test reflexes in the abdomen. Testing reflexes
of the trunk is not commonly performed in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem with the thoracic
segments of the spinal cord, a series of superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to those segments. If
contraction is not observed when the skin lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what level of the spinal
cord may be damaged?

Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage

Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to the motor system is
in the upper or lower motor neurons. Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness, strong deep tendon
reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign, spasticity, and the clasp-
knife response. Spasticity is an excess contraction in resistance to stretch. It can result in hyperflexia, which is when joints
are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially resists movement, but then releases, and the
joint will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.

A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as
paresis. The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred to as flaccid paralysis, referring to a complete or partial loss

672 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

of muscle tone, in contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained and spasticity is exhibited. Other
signs of an LMN lesion are fibrillation, fasciculation, and compromised or lost reflexes resulting from the denervation of
the muscle fibers.

isorders |OF THE...

Spinal Cord

In certain situations, such as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in what is known
as a hemisection. Forceful trauma to the trunk may cause ribs or vertebrae to fracture, and debris can crush or section
through part of the spinal cord. The full section of a spinal cord would result in paraplegia, or loss of voluntary motor
control of the lower body, as well as loss of sensations from that point down. A hemisection, however, will leave spinal
cord tracts intact on one side. The resulting condition would be hemiplegia on the side of the trauma—one leg would
be paralyzed. The sensory results are more complicated.

The ascending tracts in the spinal cord are segregated between the dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways.
This means that the sensory deficits will be based on the particular sensory information each pathway conveys. Sensory
discrimination between touch and painful stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways divide these
functions.

On the paralyzed leg, a patient will acknowledge painful stimuli, but not fine touch or proprioceptive sensations.
On the functional leg, the opposite is true. The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway ascends ipsilateral
to the sensation, so it would be damaged the same way as the lateral corticospinal tract. The spinothalamic pathway
decussates immediately upon entering the spinal cord and ascends contralateral to the source; it would therefore bypass
the hemisection.

The motor system can indicate the loss of input to the ventral horn in the lumbar enlargement where motor neurons
to the leg are found, but motor function in the trunk is less clear. The left and right anterior corticospinal tracts are
directly adjacent to each other. The likelihood of trauma to the spinal cord resulting in a hemisection that affects one
anterior column, but not the other, is very unlikely. Either the axial musculature will not be affected at all, or there will
be bilateral losses in the trunk.

Sensory discrimination can pinpoint the level of damage in the spinal cord. Below the hemisection, pain stimuli
will be perceived in the damaged side, but not fine touch. The opposite is true on the other side. The pain fibers on
the side with motor function cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral lateral column as far
as the hemisection. The dorsal column will be intact ipsilateral to the source on the intact side and reach the brain for
conscious perception. The trauma would be at the level just before sensory discrimination returns to normal, helping to
pinpoint the trauma. Whereas imaging technology, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
(CT) scanning, could localize the injury as well, nothing more complicated than a cotton-tipped applicator can localize
the damage. That may be all that is available on the scene when moving the victim requires crucial decisions be made.

16.5 | The Coordination and Gait Exams

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain the relationship between the location of the cerebellum and its function in movement
* Chart the major divisions of the cerebellum
¢ List the major connections of the cerebellum
¢ Describe the relationship of the cerebellum to axial and appendicular musculature
¢ Explain the prevalent causes of cerebellar ataxia

The role of the cerebellum is a subject of debate. There is an obvious connection to motor function based on the clinical
implications of cerebellar damage. There is also strong evidence of the cerebellar role in procedural memory. The two are
not incompatible; in fact, procedural memory is motor memory, such as learning to ride a bicycle. Significant work has been
performed to describe the connections within the cerebellum that result in learning. A model for this learning is classical
conditioning, as shown by the famous dogs from the physiologist Ivan Pavlov’s work. This classical conditioning, which
can be related to motor learning, fits with the neural connections of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is 10 percent of the
mass of the brain and has varied functions that all point to a role in the motor system.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 673

Location and Connections of the Cerebellum

The cerebellum is located in apposition to the dorsal surface of the brain stem, centered on the pons. The name of the pons
is derived from its connection to the cerebellum. The word means “bridge” and refers to the thick bundle of myelinated
axons that form a bulge on its ventral surface. Those fibers are axons that project from the gray matter of the pons into the
contralateral cerebellar cortex. These fibers make up the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) and are the major physical
connection of the cerebellum to the brain stem (Figure 16.14). Two other white matter bundles connect the cerebellum to
the other regions of the brain stem. The superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) is the connection of the cerebellum to the
midbrain and forebrain. The inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) is the connection to the medulla.

Superior peduncle

Inferior peduncle
Middle peduncle

Pons

Inferior peduncle

Figure 16.14 Cerebellar Penduncles The connections to the cerebellum are the three cerebellar peduncles, which
are close to each other. The ICP arises from the medulla—specifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a
bulge on the ventral surface of the brain stem. The MCP is the ventral surface of the pons. The SCP projects into the
midbrain.

These connections can also be broadly described by their functions. The ICP conveys sensory input to the cerebellum,
partially from the spinocerebellar tract, but also through fibers of the inferior olive. The MCP is part of the cortico-ponto-
cerebellar pathway that connects the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum and preferentially targets the lateral regions of the
cerebellum. It includes a copy of the motor commands sent from the precentral gyrus through the corticospinal tract, arising
from collateral branches that synapse in the gray matter of the pons, along with input from other regions such as the visual
cortex. The SCP is the major output of the cerebellum, divided between the red nucleus in the midbrain and the thalamus,
which will return cerebellar processing to the motor cortex. These connections describe a circuit that compares motor
commands and sensory feedback to generate a new output. These comparisons make it possible to coordinate movements.
If the cerebral cortex sends a motor command to initiate walking, that command is copied by the pons and sent into the
cerebellum through the MCP. Sensory feedback in the form of proprioception from the spinal cord, as well as vestibular
sensations from the inner ear, enters through the ICP. If you take a step and begin to slip on the floor because it is wet, the
output from the cerebellum—through the SCP—can correct for that and keep you balanced and moving. The red nucleus
sends new motor commands to the spinal cord through the rubrospinal tract.

The cerebellum is divided into regions that are based on the particular functions and connections involved. The
midline regions of the cerebellum, the vermis and flocculonodular lobe, are involved in comparing visual information,
equilibrium, and proprioceptive feedback to maintain balance and coordinate movements such as walking, or gait, through
the descending output of the red nucleus (Figure 16.15). The lateral hemispheres are primarily concerned with planning
motor functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the thalamic projections back to the premotor and
motor cortices. Processing in the midline regions targets movements of the axial musculature, whereas the lateral regions
target movements of the appendicular musculature. The vermis is referred to as the spinocerebellum because it primarily
receives input from the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar pathways. The flocculonodular lobe is referred to as the
vestibulocerebellum because of the vestibular projection into that region. Finally, the lateral cerebellum is referred to as the
cerebrocerebellum, reflecting the significant input from the cerebral cortex through the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway.

Coordination and Alternating Movement

Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam. The subtests target appendicular musculature,
controlling the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of cerebellar function will depend on
the normal functioning of other systems addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor control from the
cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar function.

The subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a
check for tremor. The patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position. The examiner watches for the
presence of tremors that would not be present if the muscles are relaxed. By pushing down on the arms in this position,
the examiner can check for the rebound response, which is when the arms are automatically brought back to the extended
position. The extension of the arms is an ongoing motor process, and the tap or push on the arms presents a change in
the proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum compares the cerebral motor command with the proprioceptive feedback and
adjusts the descending input to correct. The red nucleus would send an additional signal to the LMN for the arm to increase
contraction momentarily to overcome the change and regain the original position.

The check reflex depends on cerebellar input to keep increased contraction from continuing after the removal of
resistance. The patient flexes the elbow against resistance from the examiner to extend the elbow. When the examiner
releases the arm, the patient should be able to stop the increased contraction and keep the arm from moving. A similar
response would be seen if you try to pick up a coffee mug that you believe to be full but turns out to be empty. Without
checking the contraction, the mug would be thrown from the overexertion of the muscles expecting to lift a heavier object.

Several subtests of the cerebellum assess the ability to alternate movements, or switch between muscle groups that may
be antagonistic to each other. In the finger-to-nose test, the patient touches their finger to the examiner’s finger and then to
their nose, and then back to the examiner’s finger, and back to the nose. The examiner moves the target finger to assess a
range of movements. A similar test for the lower extremities has the patient touch their toe to a moving target, such as the
examiner’s finger. Both of these tests involve flexion and extension around a joint—the elbow or the knee and the shoulder
or hip—as well as movements of the wrist and ankle. The patient must switch between the opposing muscles, like the biceps
and triceps brachii, to move their finger from the target to their nose. Coordinating these movements involves the motor
cortex communicating with the cerebellum through the pons and feedback through the thalamus to plan the movements.
Visual cortex information is also part of the processing that occurs in the cerebrocerebellum while it is involved in guiding
movements of the finger or toe.

Rapid, alternating movements are tested for the upper and lower extremities. The patient is asked to touch each finger
to their thumb, or to pat the palm of one hand on the back of the other, and then flip that hand over and alternate back-and-
forth. To test similar function in the lower extremities, the patient touches their heel to their shin near the knee and slides
it down toward the ankle, and then back again, repetitively. Rapid, alternating movements are part of speech as well. A
patient is asked to repeat the nonsense consonants “lah-kah-pah” to alternate movements of the tongue, lips, and palate. All
of these rapid alternations require planning from the cerebrocerebellum to coordinate movement commands that control the
coordination.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 675

Posture and Gait

Gait can either be considered a separate part of the neurological exam or a subtest of the coordination exam that addresses
walking and balance. Testing posture and gait addresses functions of the spinocerebellum and the vestibulocerebellum
because both are part of these activities. A subtest called station begins with the patient standing in a normal position to
check for the placement of the feet and balance. The patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain
balance and posture during movement. Though the station subtest appears to be similar to the Romberg test, the difference
is that the patient’s eyes are open during station. The Romberg test has the patient stand still with the eyes closed. Any
changes in posture would be the result of proprioceptive deficits, and the patient is able to recover when they open their
eyes.

Subtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally for a distance away from the examiner, and then turn
and return to the starting position. The examiner watches for abnormal placement of the feet and the movement of the arms
relative to the movement. The patient is then asked to walk with a few different variations. Tandem gait is when the patient
places the heel of one foot against the toe of the other foot and walks in a straight line in that manner. Walking only on the
heels or only on the toes will test additional aspects of balance.

Ataxia

A movement disorder of the cerebellum is referred to as ataxia. It presents as a loss of coordination in voluntary
movements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that cause balance problems, primarily in proprioception and
equilibrium. When the problem is observed in movement, it is ascribed to cerebellar damage. Sensory and vestibular ataxia
would likely also present with problems in gait and station.

Ataxia is often the result of exposure to exogenous substances, focal lesions, or a genetic disorder. Focal lesions
include strokes affecting the cerebellar arteries, tumors that may impinge on the cerebellum, trauma to the back of the
head and neck, or MS. Alcohol intoxication or drugs such as ketamine cause ataxia, but it is often reversible. Mercury in
fish can cause ataxia as well. Hereditary conditions can lead to degeneration of the cerebellum or spinal cord, as well as
malformation of the brain, or the abnormal accumulation of copper seen in Wilson’s disease.

Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/stationtest) to see a test for station. Station refers to the position
a person adopts when they are standing still. The examiner would look for issues with balance, which coordinates
proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual information in the cerebellum. To test the ability of a subject to maintain balance,
asking them to stand or hop on one foot can be more demanding. The examiner may also push the subject to see if they
can maintain balance. An abnormal finding in the test of station is if the feet are placed far apart. Why would a wide
stance suggest problems with cerebellar function?

676 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

Everyday CONNECTION

The Field Sobriety Test

The neurological exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter. It is also useful in other ways.
A variation of the coordination exam is the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are under the
influence of alcohol. The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated movements such as keeping balance while walking,
or moving appendicular musculature on the basis of proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum is also very sensitive to
ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in beer, wine, and liquor.

Walking in a straight line involves comparing the motor command from the primary motor cortex to the
proprioceptive and vestibular sensory feedback, as well as following the visual guide of the white line on the side of the
road. When the cerebellum is compromised by alcohol, the cerebellum cannot coordinate these movements effectively,
and maintaining balance becomes difficult.

Another common aspect of the FST is to have the driver extend their arms out wide and touch their fingertip to
their nose, usually with their eyes closed. The point of this is to remove the visual feedback for the movement and
force the driver to rely just on proprioceptive information about the movement and position of their fingertip relative
to their nose. With eyes open, the corrections to the movement of the arm might be so small as to be hard to see, but
proprioceptive feedback is not as immediate and broader movements of the arm will probably be needed, particularly
if the cerebellum is affected by alcohol.

Reciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST, but its relationship to neurological
function is interesting. There is a cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite it
backwards. That is actually a variation of the mental status subtest of repeating the months backwards. However, the
cerebellum is important because speech production is a coordinated activity. The speech rapid alternating movement
subtest is specifically using the consonant changes of “lah-kah-pah” to assess coordinated movements of the lips,
tongue, pharynx, and palate. But the entire alphabet, especially in the nonrehearsed backwards order, pushes this type
of coordinated movement quite far. It is related to the reason that speech becomes slurred when a person is intoxicated.

CHAPTER REVIEW

16.1 Overview of the Neurological Exam

The neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool to determine the extent of function from the nervous system. It is divided
into five major sections that each deal with a specific region of the CNS. The mental status exam is concerned with the
cerebrum and assesses higher functions such as memory, language, and emotion. The cranial nerve exam tests the functions
of all of the cranial nerves and, therefore, their connections to the CNS through the forebrain and brain stem. The sensory
and motor exams assess those functions as they relate to the spinal cord, as well as the combination of the functions in spinal
reflexes. The coordination exam targets cerebellar function in coordinated movements, including those functions associated
with gait.

Damage to and disease of the nervous system lead to loss of function. The location of the injury will correspond to the
functional loss, as suggested by the principle of localization of function. The neurological exam provides the opportunity
for a clinician to determine where damage has occurred on the basis of the function that is lost. Damage from acute injuries
such as strokes may result in specific functions being lost, whereas broader effects in infection or developmental disorders
may result in general losses across an entire section of the neurological exam.

16.4 The Sensory and Motor Exams

The sensory and motor exams assess function related to the spinal cord and the nerves connected to it. Sensory functions are
associated with the dorsal regions of the spinal cord, whereas motor function is associated with the ventral side. Localizing
damage to the spinal cord is related to assessments of the peripheral projections mapped to dermatomes.

Sensory tests address the various submodalities of the somatic senses: touch, temperature, vibration, pain, and
proprioception. Results of the subtests can point to trauma in the spinal cord gray matter, white matter, or even in
connections to the cerebral cortex.

Motor tests focus on the function of the muscles and the connections of the descending motor pathway. Muscle tone
and strength are tested for upper and lower extremities. Input to the muscles comes from the descending cortical input of
upper motor neurons and the direct innervation of lower motor neurons.

Reflexes can either be based on deep stimulation of tendons or superficial stimulation of the skin. The presence of
reflexive contractions helps to differentiate motor disorders between the upper and lower motor neurons. The specific signs
associated with motor disorders can establish the difference further, based on the type of paralysis, the state of muscle tone,
and specific indicators such as pronator drift or the Babinski sign.

16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams

The cerebellum is an important part of motor function in the nervous system. It apparently plays a role in procedural
learning, which would include motor skills such as riding a bike or throwing a football. The basis for these roles is likely to
be tied into the role the cerebellum plays as a comparator for voluntary movement.

The motor commands from the cerebral hemispheres travel along the corticospinal pathway, which passes through
the pons. Collateral branches of these fibers synapse on neurons in the pons, which then project into the cerebellar cortex
through the middle cerebellar peduncles. Ascending sensory feedback, entering through the inferior cerebellar peduncles,
provides information about motor performance. The cerebellar cortex compares the command to the actual performance and
can adjust the descending input to compensate for any mismatch. The output from deep cerebellar nuclei projects through
the superior cerebellar peduncles to initiate descending signals from the red nucleus to the spinal cord.

The primary role of the cerebellum in relation to the spinal cord is through the spinocerebellum; it controls posture and
gait with significant input from the vestibular system. Deficits in cerebellar function result in ataxias, or a specific kind of
movement disorder. The root cause of the ataxia may be the sensory input—either the proprioceptive input from the spinal
cord or the equilibrium input from the vestibular system, or direct damage to the cerebellum by stroke, trauma, hereditary
factors, or toxins.

INTERACTIVE LINK QUESTIONS

1. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
neuroexam) that provides a demonstration of the
neurological exam—a series of tests that can be performed
rapidly when a patient is initially brought into an emergency
department. The exam can be repeated on a regular basis to
keep a record of how and if neurological function changes
over time. In what order were the sections of the
neurological exam tested in this video, and which section
seemed to be left out?

2. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
neuroexam2) for an introduction to the neurological exam.
Studying the neurological exam can give insight into how
structure and function in the nervous system are
interdependent. This is a tool both in the clinic and in the
classroom, but for different reasons. In the clinic, this is a
powerful but simple tool to assess a patient’s neurological
function. In the classroom, it is a different way to think about
the nervous system. Though medical technology provides
noninvasive imaging and real-time functional data, the
presenter says these cannot replace the history at the core
of the medical examination. What does history mean in the
context of medical practice?

3. Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/3word)
to learn about a young man who texts his fiancée in a panic
as he finds that he is having trouble remembering things.
At the hospital, a neurologist administers the mental status
exam, which is mostly normal except for the three-word
recall test. The young man could not recall them even 30
seconds after hearing them and repeating them back to the
doctor. An undiscovered mass in the mediastinum region
was found to be Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer that
affects the immune system and likely caused antibodies to
attack the nervous system. The patient eventually regained
his ability to remember, though the events in the hospital
were always elusive. Considering that the effects on memory
were temporary, but resulted in the loss of the specific events
of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely
to have been affected by the antibodies and what type of
memory does that represent?

4. Watch the video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/2brains)
titled “The Man With Two Brains” to see the neuroscientist
Michael Gazzaniga introduce a patient he has worked with
for years who has had his corpus callosum cut, separating his
two cerebral hemispheres. A few tests are run to demonstrate
how this manifests in tests of cerebral function. Unlike
normal people, this patient can perform two independent
tasks at the same time because the lines of communication
between the right and left sides of his brain have been
removed. Whereas a person with an intact corpus callosum
cannot overcome the dominance of one hemisphere over

the other, this patient can. If the left cerebral hemisphere
is dominant in the majority of people, why would right-
handedness be most common?

5. Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
facialnerve) to see an examination of the facial nerve using
some simple tests. The facial nerve controls the muscles
of facial expression. Severe deficits will be obvious in
watching someone use those muscles for normal control.
One side of the face might not move like the other side. But
directed tests, especially for contraction against resistance,
require a formal testing of the muscles. The muscles of the
upper and lower face need to be tested. The strength test
in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut
and the examiner trying to pry her eyes open. Why does the
examiner ask her to try a second time?

6. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/I/2point)
to see a quick demonstration of two-point discrimination.
Touching a specialized caliper to the surface of the skin will
measure the distance between two points that are perceived
as distinct stimuli versus a single stimulus. The patient keeps
their eyes closed while the examiner switches between using
both points of the caliper or just one. The patient then must
indicate whether one or two stimuli are in contact with the
skin. Why is the distance between the caliper points closer
on the fingertips as opposed to the palm of the hand? And
what do you think the distance would be on the arm, or the
shoulder?

7. Watch this video  (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
reflextest) to see how to test reflexes in the abdomen.
Testing reflexes of the trunk is not commonly performed
in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem
with the thoracic segments of the spinal cord, a series of
superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to
those segments. If contraction is not observed when the skin
lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what
level of the spinal cord may be damaged?

8. Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/
stationtest) to see a test for station. Station refers to the
position a person adopts when they are standing still. The
examiner would look for issues with balance, which
coordinates proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual
information in the cerebellum. To test the ability of a subject
to maintain balance, asking them to stand or hop on one foot
can be more demanding. The examiner may also push the
subject to see if they can maintain balance. An abnormal
finding in the test of station is if the feet are placed far apart.
Why would a wide stance suggest problems with cerebellar
function?

You may never have thought of it this way, but when you send a text message to two friends to meet you at the dining hal
at six, you’re sending digital signals that (you hope) will affect their behavior—even though they are some distance away.
Similarly, certain cells send chemical signals to other cells in the body that influence their behavior. This long-distance
intercellular communication, coordination, and control is critical for homeostasis, and it is the fundamental function of the
endocrine system.

17.1 | An Overview of the Endocrine System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Distinguish the types of intercellular communication, their importance, mechanisms, and effects
¢ Identify the major organs and tissues of the endocrine system and their location in the body

Communication is a process in which a sender transmits signals to one or more receivers to control and coordinate actions.
In the human body, two major organ systems participate in relatively “long distance” communication: the nervous system
and the endocrine system. Together, these two systems are primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the body.

Neural and Endocrine Signaling

The nervous system uses two types of intercellular communication—electrical and chemical signaling—either by the direct
action of an electrical potential, or in the latter case, through the action of chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin or
norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters act locally and rapidly. When an electrical signal in the form of an action potential arrives
at the synaptic terminal, they diffuse across the synaptic cleft (the gap between a sending neuron and a receiving neuron
or muscle cell). Once the neurotransmitters interact (bind) with receptors on the receiving (post-synaptic) cell, the receptor
stimulation is transduced into a response such as continued electrical signaling or modification of cellular response. The
target cell responds within milliseconds of receiving the chemical “message”; this response then ceases very quickly once
the neural signaling ends. In this way, neural communication enables body functions that involve quick, brief actions, such
as movement, sensation, and cognition.In contrast, the endocrine system uses just one method of communication: chemical
signaling. These signals are sent by the endocrine organs, which secrete chemicals—the hormone—into the extracellular
fluid. Hormones are transported primarily via the bloodstream throughout the body, where they bind to receptors on target
cells, inducing a characteristic response. As a result, endocrine signaling requires more time than neural signaling to prompt
a response in target cells, though the precise amount of time varies with different hormones. For example, the hormones
released when you are confronted with a dangerous or frightening situation, called the fight-or-flight response, occur by the
release of adrenal hormones—epinephrine and norepinephrine—within seconds. In contrast, it may take up to 48 hours for
target cells to respond to certain reproductive hormones.

In addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling. The same hormone may play a role in
a variety of different physiological processes depending on the target cells involved. For example, the hormone oxytocin

promotes uterine contractions in women in labor. It is also important in breastfeeding, and may be involved in the sexual
response and in feelings of emotional attachment in both males and females.

In general, the nervous system involves quick responses to rapid changes in the external environment, and the
endocrine system is usually slower acting—taking care of the internal environment of the body, maintaining homeostasis,
and controlling reproduction (Table 17.1). So how does the fight-or-flight response that was mentioned earlier happen so
quickly if hormones are usually slower acting? It is because the two systems are connected. It is the fast action of the
nervous system in response to the danger in the environment that stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete their hormones.
As a result, the nervous system can cause rapid endocrine responses to keep up with sudden changes in both the external
and internal environments when necessary.

Structures of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function.
The endocrine gland is the major player in this system. The primary function of these ductless glands is to secrete their
hormones directly into the surrounding fluid. The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport the hormones
throughout the body. The endocrine system includes the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal glands (Figure
17.2). Some of these glands have both endocrine and non-endocrine functions. For example, the pancreas contains cells that
function in digestion as well as cells that secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels.
The hypothalamus, thymus, heart, kidneys, stomach, small intestine, liver, skin, female ovaries, and male testes are other
organs that contain cells with endocrine function. Moreover, adipose tissue has long been known to produce hormones, and
recent research has revealed that even bone tissue has endocrine functions.

The ductless endocrine glands are not to be confused with the body’s exocrine system, whose glands release their
secretions through ducts. Examples of exocrine glands include the sebaceous and sweat glands of the skin. As just noted,
the pancreas also has an exocrine function: most of its cells secrete pancreatic juice through the pancreatic and accessory
ducts to the lumen of the small intestine.

Other Types of Chemical Signaling

In endocrine signaling, hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph, and can then travel
great distances throughout the body. In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An autocrine (auto-
= “self”) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or IL-1, is a signaling molecule
that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have receptors on their cell surface that
bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling.

Local intercellular communication is the province of the paracrine, also called a paracrine factor, which is a chemical
that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their concentration is generally
too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma is histamine, a paracrine that
is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi to constrict,
narrowing the airways. Another example is the neurotransmitters of the nervous system, which act only locally within the
synaptic cleft.

Endocrinologist

Endocrinology is a specialty in the field of medicine that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.
Endocrinologists—medical doctors who specialize in this field—are experts in treating diseases associated with
hormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to diabetes mellitus. Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease
through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.

Patients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or blood test results that suggest
excessive or impaired functioning of an endocrine gland or endocrine cells. The endocrinologist may order additional
blood tests to determine whether the patient’s hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the
function of the suspect endocrine gland and then have blood taken for analysis. Treatment varies according to the
diagnosis. Some endocrine disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, may respond to lifestyle changes such as modest weight
loss, adoption of a healthy diet, and regular physical activity. Other disorders may require medication, such as hormone
replacement, and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist. These include disorders of the pituitary gland that can
affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.

Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany
aging. These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement
therapy intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.

In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of
endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.

17.2 | Hormones

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure
¢ Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors
* Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3
¢ Identify several factors that influence a target cell’s response
* Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control

Although a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its
target cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone. Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a chain of
events is initiated that leads to the target cell’s response. Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of physiological
processes because of the target cell responses they regulate. These responses contribute to human reproduction, growth and
development of body tissues, metabolism, fluid, and electrolyte balance, sleep, and many other body functions. The major
hormones of the human body and their effects are identified in Table 17.2.

Types of Hormones

The hormones of the human body can be divided into two major groups on the basis of their chemical structure. Hormones
derived from amino acids include amines, peptides, and proteins. Those derived from lipids include steroids (Figure 17.3).
These chemical groups affect a hormone’s distribution, the type of receptors it binds to, and other aspects of its function.

Amine Hormones

Hormones derived from the modification of amino acids are referred to as amine hormones. Typically, the original structure
of the amino acid is modified such that a—COOH, or carboxyl, group is removed, whereas the -NH3 , or amine, group

remains.

Amine hormones are synthesized from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine. An example of a hormone derived from
tryptophan is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland and helps regulate circadian rhythm. Tyrosine derivatives
include the metabolism-regulating thyroid hormones, as well as the catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are secreted by the adrenal medulla and play a role in the fight-or-flight
response, whereas dopamine is secreted by the hypothalamus and inhibits the release of certain anterior pituitary hormones.

692 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

Peptide and Protein Hormones

Whereas the amine hormones are derived from a single amino acid, peptide and protein hormones consist of multiple amino
acids that link to form an amino acid chain. Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids, whereas protein
hormones are longer polypeptides. Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is transcribed into mRNA,
which is translated into an amino acid chain.

Examples of peptide hormones include antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a pituitary hormone important in fluid balance,
and atrial-natriuretic peptide, which is produced by the heart and helps to decrease blood pressure. Some examples of
protein hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), which has an attached carbohydrate group and is thus classified as a glycoprotein. FSH helps stimulate the
maturation of eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes.

Steroid Hormones

The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids. Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol. For
example, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens—which are produced by the gonads (testes and
ovaries)—are steroid hormones. The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved in
osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism.

Like cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in water (they are hydrophobic). Because blood is water-based,
lipid-derived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport protein. This more complex structure extends
the half-life of steroid hormones much longer than that of hormones derived from amino acids. A hormone’s half-life is the
time required for half the concentration of the hormone to be degraded. For example, the lipid-derived hormone cortisol has
a half-life of approximately 60 to 90 minutes. In contrast, the amino acid—derived hormone epinephrine has a half-life of
approximately one minute.

Pathways of Hormone Action

The message a hormone sends is received by a hormone receptor, a protein located either inside the cell or within the cell
membrane. The receptor will process the message by initiating other signaling events or cellular mechanisms that result in
the target cell’s response. Hormone receptors recognize molecules with specific shapes and side groups, and respond only to
those hormones that are recognized. The same type of receptor may be located on cells in different body tissues, and trigger
somewhat different responses. Thus, the response triggered by a hormone depends not only on the hormone, but also on the
target cell.

Once the target cell receives the hormone signal, it can respond in a variety of ways. The response may include the
stimulation of protein synthesis, activation or deactivation of enzymes, alteration in the permeability of the cell membrane,
altered rates of mitosis and cell growth, and stimulation of the secretion of products. Moreover, a single hormone may be
capable of inducing different responses in a given cell.

Pathways Involving Intracellular Hormone Receptors

Intracellular hormone receptors are located inside the cell. Hormones that bind to this type of receptor must be able to cross
the cell membrane. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and therefore can readily diffuse through the lipid bilayer
of the cell membrane to reach the intracellular receptor (Figure 17.4). Thyroid hormones, which contain benzene rings
studded with iodine, are also lipid-soluble and can enter the cell.

The location of steroid and thyroid hormone binding differs slightly: a steroid hormone may bind to its receptor within
the cytosol or within the nucleus. In either case, this binding generates a hormone-receptor complex that moves toward
the chromatin in the cell nucleus and binds to a particular segment of the cell’s DNA. In contrast, thyroid hormones bind
to receptors already bound to DNA. For both steroid and thyroid hormones, binding of the hormone-receptor complex
with DNA triggers transcription of a target gene to mRNA, which moves to the cytosol and directs protein synthesis by
ribosomes.

Figure 17.4 Binding of Lipid-Soluble Hormones A steroid hormone directly initiates the production of proteins
within a target cell. Steroid hormones easily diffuse through the cell membrane. The hormone binds to its receptor in
the cytosol, forming a receptor—hormone complex. The receptor-hormone complex then enters the nucleus and binds
to the target gene on the DNA. Transcription of the gene creates a messenger RNA that is translated into the desired
protein within the cytoplasm.

Pathways Involving Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors

Hydrophilic, or water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must
therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell. Except for thyroid hormones, which are
lipid-soluble, all amino acid—derived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least in part, on the
extracellular surface of the cell membrane. Therefore, they do not directly affect the transcription of target genes, but instead
initiate a signaling cascade that is carried out by a molecule called a second messenger. In this case, the hormone is called
a first messenger.

The second messenger used by most hormones is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the cAMP second
messenger system, a water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 in Figure 17.5). This
receptor is associated with an intracellular component called a G protein, and binding of the hormone activates the G-
protein component (Step 2). The activated G protein in turn activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, also known as
adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4). As the second messenger,
cAMP activates a type of enzyme called a protein kinase that is present in the cytosol (Step 5). Activated protein kinases
initiate a phosphorylation cascade, in which multiple protein kinases phosphorylate (add a phosphate group to) numerous
and various cellular proteins, including other enzymes (Step 6).

Figure 17.5 Binding of Water-Soluble Hormones Water-soluble hormones cannot diffuse through the cell
membrane. These hormones must bind to a surface cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cell-
signaling pathway within the cell involving G proteins, adenylyl cyclase, the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP),
and protein kinases. In the final step, these protein kinases phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates
proteins in the cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone.

The phosphorylation of cellular proteins can trigger a wide variety of effects, from nutrient metabolism to the synthesis
of different hormones and other products. The effects vary according to the type of target cell, the G proteins and kinases
involved, and the phosphorylation of proteins. Examples of hormones that use cAMP as a second messenger include
calcitonin, which is important for bone construction and regulating blood calcium levels; glucagon, which plays a role in
blood glucose levels; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the release of T3 and T4 from the thyroid gland.

Overall, the phosphorylation cascade significantly increases the efficiency, speed, and specificity of the hormonal
response, as thousands of signaling events can be initiated simultaneously in response to a very low concentration of
hormone in the bloodstream. However, the duration of the hormone signal is short, as cAMP is quickly deactivated by the
enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which is located in the cytosol. The action of PDE helps to ensure that a target cell’s
response ceases quickly unless new hormones arrive at the cell membrane.

Importantly, there are also G proteins that decrease the levels of cAMP in the cell in response to hormone binding.
For example, when growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also known as somatostatin, binds to its receptors in the
pituitary gland, the level of cAMP decreases, thereby inhibiting the secretion of human growth hormone.

Not all water-soluble hormones initiate the cAMP second messenger system. One common alternative system uses
calcium ions as a second messenger. In this system, G proteins activate the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), which
functions similarly to adenylyl cyclase. Once activated, PLC cleaves a membrane-bound phospholipid into two molecules:
diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Like cAMP, DAG activates protein kinases that initiate a
phosphorylation cascade. At the same time, IP3 causes calcium ions to be released from storage sites within the cytosol, such
as from within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions then act as second messengers in two ways: they can
influence enzymatic and other cellular activities directly, or they can bind to calcium-binding proteins, the most common
of which is calmodulin. Upon binding calcium, calmodulin is able to modulate protein kinase within the cell. Examples of
hormones that use calcium ions as a second messenger system include angiotensin II, which helps regulate blood pressure
through vasoconstriction, and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which causes the pituitary gland to release
growth hormones.

Factors Affecting Target Cell Response

You will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a response.
But several other factors influence the target cell response. For example, the presence of a significant level of a hormone
circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for that hormone. This
process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive hormone levels. When the
level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase their number of receptors. This

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 695

process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. Cells can also alter the sensitivity of the receptors
themselves to various hormones.

Two or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. The three most common types
of interaction are as follows:

* The permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act. For example, thyroid
hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones. A dietary deficiency of iodine,
a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning.

* The synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response. In some cases, two
hormones are required for an adequate response. For example, two different reproductive hormones—FSH from the
pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries—are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells).

* The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two
pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the liver’s storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing
blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood glucose.

Regulation of Hormone Secretion

To prevent abnormal hormone levels and a potential disease state, hormone levels must be tightly controlled. The body
maintains this control by balancing hormone production and degradation. Feedback loops govern the initiation and
maintenance of most hormone secretion in response to various stimuli.

Role of Feedback Loops

The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are
characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin
during childbirth is a positive feedback loop. The initial release of oxytocin begins to signal the uterine muscles to contract,
which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more
oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child.

The more common method of hormone regulation is the negative feedback loop. Negative feedback is characterized by
the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone. This allows blood levels of
the hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release of glucocorticoid
hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. As glucocorticoid concentrations
in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional
glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6).

Figure 17.6 Negative Feedback Loop The release of adrenal glucocorticoids is stimulated by the release of
hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This signaling is inhibited when glucocorticoid levels become
elevated by causing negative signals to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.

Role of Endocrine Gland Stimuli

Reflexes triggered by both chemical and neural stimuli control endocrine activity. These reflexes may be simple, involving
only one hormone response, or they may be more complex and involve many hormones, as is the case with the hypothalamic
control of various anterior pituitary—controlled hormones.

Humoral stimuli are changes in blood levels of non-hormone chemicals, such as nutrients or ions, which cause the
release or inhibition of a hormone to, in turn, maintain homeostasis. For example, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect
changes in blood osmolarity (the concentration of solutes in the blood plasma). If blood osmolarity is too high, meaning that
the blood is not dilute enough, osmoreceptors signal the hypothalamus to release ADH. The hormone causes the kidneys to
reabsorb more water and reduce the volume of urine produced. This reabsorption causes a reduction of the osmolarity of the
blood, diluting the blood to the appropriate level. The regulation of blood glucose is another example. High blood glucose
levels cause the release of insulin from the pancreas, which increases glucose uptake by cells and liver storage of glucose
as glycogen.

An endocrine gland may also secrete a hormone in response to the presence of another hormone produced by a different
endocrine gland. Such hormonal stimuli often involve the hypothalamus, which produces releasing and inhibiting hormones
that control the secretion of a variety of pituitary hormones.

In addition to these chemical signals, hormones can also be released in response to neural stimuli. A common example
of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system. When an individual
perceives danger, sympathetic neurons signal the adrenal glands to secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine. The two
hormones dilate blood vessels, increase the heart and respiratory rate, and suppress the digestive and immune systems.
These responses boost the body’s transport of oxygen to the brain and muscles, thereby improving the body’s ability to fight
or flee.

Everyday CONNECTION

Bisphenol A and Endocrine Disruption

You may have heard news reports about the effects of a chemical called bisphenol A (BPA) in various types of food
packaging. BPA is used in the manufacturing of hard plastics and epoxy resins. Common food-related items that may
contain BPA include the lining of aluminum cans, plastic food-storage containers, drinking cups, as well as baby bottles
and “sippy” cups. Other uses of BPA include medical equipment, dental fillings, and the lining of water pipes.
Research suggests that BPA is an endocrine disruptor, meaning that it negatively interferes with the endocrine
system, particularly during the prenatal and postnatal development period. In particular, BPA mimics the hormonal
effects of estrogens and has the opposite effect—that of androgens. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
notes in their statement about BPA safety that although traditional toxicology studies have supported the safety of low
levels of exposure to BPA, recent studies using novel approaches to test for subtle effects have led to some concern
about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and young children. The
FDA is currently facilitating decreased use of BPA in food-related materials. Many US companies have voluntarily
removed BPA from baby bottles, “sippy” cups, and the linings of infant formula cans, and most plastic reusable water
bottles sold today boast that they are “BPA free.” In contrast, both Canada and the European Union have completely
banned the use of BPA in baby products.
The potential harmful effects of BPA have been studied in both animal models and humans and include a large
variety of health effects, such as developmental delay and disease. For example, prenatal exposure to BPA during the
first trimester of human pregnancy may be associated with wheezing and aggressive behavior during childhood. Adults
exposed to high levels of BPA may experience altered thyroid signaling and male sexual dysfunction. BPA exposure
during the prenatal or postnatal period of development in animal models has been observed to cause neurological
delays, changes in brain structure and function, sexual dysfunction, asthma, and increased risk for multiple cancers.
In vitro studies have also shown that BPA exposure causes molecular changes that initiate the development of cancers
of the breast, prostate, and brain. Although these studies have implicated BPA in numerous ill health effects, some
experts caution that some of these studies may be flawed and that more research needs to be done. In the meantime, the
FDA recommends that consumers take precautions to limit their exposure to BPA. In addition to purchasing foods in
packaging free of BPA, consumers should avoid carrying or storing foods or liquids in bottles with the recycling code
3 or 7. Foods and liquids should not be microwave-heated in any form of plastic: use paper, glass, or ceramics instead.

17.3 | The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ Explain the interrelationships of the anatomy and functions of the hypothalamus and the posterior and anterior lobes
of the pituitary gland

¢ Identify the two hormones released from the posterior pituitary, their target cells, and their principal actions

¢ Identify the six hormones produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, their target cells, their principal
actions, and their regulation by the hypothalamus

The hypothalamus-pituitary complex can be thought of as the “command center” of the endocrine system. This complex
secretes several hormones that directly produce responses in target tissues, as well as hormones that regulate the synthesis
and secretion of hormones of other glands. In addition, the hypothalamus-pituitary complex coordinates the messages
of the endocrine and nervous systems. In many cases, a stimulus received by the nervous system must pass through the
hypothalamus-pituitary complex to be translated into hormones that can initiate a response.

The hypothalamus is a structure of the diencephalon of the brain located anterior and inferior to the thalamus (Figure
17.7). It has both neural and endocrine functions, producing and secreting many hormones. In addition, the hypothalamus
is anatomically and functionally related to the pituitary gland (or hypophysis), a bean-sized organ suspended from it
by a stem called the infundibulum (or pituitary stalk). The pituitary gland is cradled within the sellaturcica of the
sphenoid bone of the skull. It consists of two lobes that arise from distinct parts of embryonic tissue: the posterior pituitary
(neurohypophysis) is neural tissue, whereas the anterior pituitary (also known as the adenohypophysis) is glandular tissue
that develops from the primitive digestive tract. The hormones secreted by the posterior and anterior pituitary, and the
intermediate zone between the lobes are summarized in Table 17.3.

Posterior Pituitary

The posterior pituitary is actually an extension of the neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the
hypothalamus. The cell bodies of these regions rest in the hypothalamus, but their axons descend as the
hypothalamic—hypophyseal tract within the infundibulum, and end in axon terminals that comprise the posterior pituitary
(Figure 17.8).

Figure 17.8 Posterior Pituitary Neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus release oxytocin (OT) or ADH into the

The posterior pituitary gland does not produce hormones, but rather stores and secretes hormones produced by the
hypothalamus. The paraventricular nuclei produce the hormone oxytocin, whereas the supraoptic nuclei produce ADH.
These hormones travel along the axons into storage sites in the axon terminals of the posterior pituitary. In response to
signals from the same hypothalamic neurons, the hormones are released from the axon terminals into the bloodstream.

Oxytocin

When fetal development is complete, the peptide-derived hormone oxytocin (tocia- = “childbirth”) stimulates uterine
contractions and dilation of the cervix. Throughout most of pregnancy, oxytocin hormone receptors are not expressed at high
levels in the uterus. Toward the end of pregnancy, the synthesis of oxytocin receptors in the uterus increases, and the smooth
muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects. Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth
through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head
toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus
and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional
dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth.

Although the mother’s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues
to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to
as “let-down”) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to
the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother’s
milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth. Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to
contribute to parent-newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love
and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.

Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

The solute concentration of the blood, or blood osmolarity, may change in response to the consumption of certain foods
and fluids, as well as in response to disease, injury, medications, or other factors. Blood osmolarity is constantly monitored
by osmoreceptors—specialized cells within the hypothalamus that are particularly sensitive to the concentration of sodium
ions and other solutes.

In response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the
osmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The target cells of ADH are located
in the tubular cells of the kidneys. Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing increased water
reabsorption. The more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is returned to the blood


700 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

and the less that is excreted in the urine. A greater concentration of water results in a reduced concentration of solutes.
ADH is also known as vasopressin because, in very high concentrations, it causes constriction of blood vessels, which
increases blood pressure by increasing peripheral resistance. The release of ADH is controlled by a negative feedback loop.
As blood osmolarity decreases, the hypothalamic osmoreceptors sense the change and prompt a corresponding decrease in
the secretion of ADH. As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the urine filtrate.

Interestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH. For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH,
resulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover. A disease called diabetes
insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration. Because little ADH is
produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Although patients feel thirsty, and increase their
fluid consumption, this doesn’t effectively decrease the solute concentration in their blood because ADH levels are not high
enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys. Electrolyte imbalances can occur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus.

Anterior Pituitary

The anterior pituitary originates from the digestive tract in the embryo and migrates toward the brain during fetal
development. There are three regions: the pars distalis is the most anterior, the pars intermedia is adjacent to the posterior
pituitary, and the pars tuberalis is a slender “tube” that wraps the infundibulum.

Recall that the posterior pituitary does not synthesize hormones, but merely stores them. In contrast, the anterior
pituitary does manufacture hormones. However, the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary is regulated by
two classes of hormones. These hormones—secreted by the hypothalamus—are the releasing hormones that stimulate the
secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary and the inhibiting hormones that inhibit secretion.

Hypothalamic hormones are secreted by neurons, but enter the anterior pituitary through blood vessels (Figure 17.9).
Within the infundibulum is a bridge of capillaries that connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary. This network,
called the hypophyseal portal system, allows hypothalamic hormones to be transported to the anterior pituitary without
first entering the systemic circulation. The system originates from the superior hypophyseal artery, which branches off
the carotid arteries and transports blood to the hypothalamus. The branches of the superior hypophyseal artery form the
hypophyseal portal system (see Figure 17.9). Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones travel through a primary
capillary plexus to the portal veins, which carry them into the anterior pituitary. Hormones produced by the anterior pituitary
(in response to releasing hormones) enter a secondary capillary plexus, and from there drain into the circulation.

Figure 17.9 Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary manufactures seven hormones. The hypothalamus produces
separate hormones that stimulate or inhibit hormone production in the anterior pituitary. Hormones from the
hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system.

The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones. These are the growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), beta
endorphin, and prolactin. Of the hormones of the anterior pituitary, TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH are collectively referred to
as tropic hormones (trope- = “turning”) because they turn on or off the function of other endocrine glands.

Growth Hormone

The endocrine system regulates the growth of the human body, protein synthesis, and cellular replication. A major hormone
involved in this process is growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropin—a protein hormone produced and secreted
by the anterior pituitary gland. Its primary function is anabolic; it promotes protein synthesis and tissue building through
direct and indirect mechanisms (Figure 17.10). GH levels are controlled by the release of GHRH and GHIH (also known
as somatostatin) from the hypothalamus.

Figure 17.10 Hormonal Regulation of Growth Growth hormone (GH) directly accelerates the rate of protein
synthesis in skeletal muscle and bones. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is activated by growth hormone and
indirectly supports the formation of new proteins in muscle cells and bone.

A glucose-sparing effect occurs when GH stimulates lipolysis, or the breakdown of adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids
into the blood. As a result, many tissues switch from glucose to fatty acids as their main energy source, which means that
less glucose is taken up from the bloodstream.

GH also initiates the diabetogenic effect in which GH stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to glucose, which
is then deposited into the blood. The name “diabetogenic” is derived from the similarity in elevated blood glucose levels
observed between individuals with untreated diabetes mellitus and individuals experiencing GH excess. Blood glucose
levels rise as the result of a combination of glucose-sparing and diabetogenic effects.

GH indirectly mediates growth and protein synthesis by triggering the liver and other tissues to produce a group of
proteins called insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). These proteins enhance cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, or
programmed cell death. IGFs stimulate cells to increase their uptake of amino acids from the blood for protein synthesis.
Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs.

Dysfunction of the endocrine system’s control of growth can result in several disorders. For example, gigantism is
a disorder in children that is caused by the secretion of abnormally large amounts of GH, resulting in excessive growth.
A similar condition in adults is acromegaly, a disorder that results in the growth of bones in the face, hands, and feet in
response to excessive levels of GH in individuals who have stopped growing. Abnormally low levels of GH in children can
cause growth impairment—a disorder called pituitary dwarfism (also known as growth hormone deficiency).

Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone

The activity of the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also called thyrotropin. TSH
is released from the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. As
discussed shortly, it triggers the secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. In a classic negative feedback loop,
elevated levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream then trigger a drop in production of TRH and subsequently TSH.

Adrenocorticotropic Hormone

The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), also called corticotropin, stimulates the adrenal cortex (the more superficial
“bark” of the adrenal glands) to secrete corticosteroid hormones such as cortisol. ACTH come from a precursor molecule

This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 703

known as pro-opiomelanotropin (POMC) which produces several biologically active molecules when cleaved, including
ACTH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the brain opioid peptides known as endorphins.

The release of ACTH is regulated by the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus in response
to normal physiologic rhythms. A variety of stressors can also influence its release, and the role of ACTH in the stress
response is discussed later in this chapter.

Follicle-Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone

The endocrine glands secrete a variety of hormones that control the development and regulation of the reproductive system
(these glands include the anterior pituitary, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads—the testes in males and the ovaries in
emales). Much of the development of the reproductive system occurs during puberty and is marked by the development
of sex-specific characteristics in both male and female adolescents. Puberty is initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH), a hormone produced and secreted by the hypothalamus. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete
gonadotropins—hormones that regulate the function of the gonads. The levels of GnRH are regulated through a negative
eedback loop; high levels of reproductive hormones inhibit the release of GnRH. Throughout life, gonadotropins regulate
reproductive function and, in the case of women, the onset and cessation of reproductive capacity.

The gonadotropins include two glycoprotein hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the
production and maturation of sex cells, or gametes, including ova in women and sperm in men. FSH also promotes follicular
growth; these follicles then release estrogens in the female ovaries. Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation in
women, as well as the production of estrogens and progesterone by the ovaries. LH stimulates production of testosterone by
the male testes.

Prolactin

As its name implies, prolactin (PRL) promotes lactation (milk production) in women. During pregnancy, it contributes to
development of the mammary glands, and after birth, it stimulates the mammary glands to produce breast milk. However,
the effects of prolactin depend heavily upon the permissive effects of estrogens, progesterone, and other hormones. And as
noted earlier, the let-down of milk occurs in response to stimulation from oxytocin.

In a non-pregnant woman, prolactin secretion is inhibited by prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), which is actually the
neurotransmitter dopamine, and is released from neurons in the hypothalamus. Only during pregnancy do prolactin levels
rise in response to prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) from the hypothalamus.

Intermediate Pituitary: Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone

The cells in the zone between the pituitary lobes secrete a hormone known as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)
that is formed by cleavage of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor protein. Local production of MSH in the skin
is responsible for melanin production in response to UV light exposure. The role of MSH made by the pituitary is more
complicated. For instance, people with lighter skin generally have the same amount of MSH as people with darker skin.
Nevertheless, this hormone is capable of darkening of the skin by inducing melanin production in the skin’s melanocytes.
Women also show increased MSH production during pregnancy; in combination with estrogens, it can lead to darker skin
pigmentation, especially the skin of the areolas and labia minora. Figure 17.11 is a summary of the pituitary hormones and
their principal effects.

* Describe the location and anatomy of the thyroid gland
* Discuss the synthesis of triiodothyronine and thyroxine
¢ Explain the role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of basal metabolism
¢ Identify the hormone produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid

A butterfly-shaped organ, the thyroid gland is located anterior to the trachea, just inferior to the larynx (Figure 17.12). The
medial region, called the isthmus, is flanked by wing-shaped left and right lobes. Each of the thyroid lobes are embedded
with parathyroid glands, primarily on their posterior surfaces. The tissue of the thyroid gland is composed mostly of thyroid
follicles. The follicles are made up of a central cavity filled with a sticky fluid called colloid. Surrounded by a wall of
epithelial follicle cells, the colloid is the center of thyroid hormone production, and that production is dependent on the
hormones’ essential and unique component: iodine.

Synthesis and Release of Thyroid Hormones

Hormones are produced in the colloid when atoms of the mineral iodine attach to a glycoprotein, called thyroglobulin, that
is secreted into the colloid by the follicle cells. The following steps outline the hormones’ assembly:
1. Binding of TSH to its receptors in the follicle cells of the thyroid gland causes the cells to actively transport iodide
ions (I) across their cell membrane, from the bloodstream into the cytosol. As a result, the concentration of iodide
ions “trapped” in the follicular cells is many times higher than the concentration in the bloodstream.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 707

2. Iodide ions then move to the lumen of the follicle cells that border the colloid. There, the ions undergo oxidation (their

negatively charged electrons are removed). The oxidation of two iodide ions (2 I’) results in iodine (12), which passes
through the follicle cell membrane into the colloid.

3. In the colloid, peroxidase enzymes link the iodine to the tyrosine amino acids in thyroglobulin to produce two
intermediaries: a tyrosine attached to one iodine and a tyrosine attached to two iodines. When one of each of these
intermediaries is linked by covalent bonds, the resulting compound is triiodothyronine (T3), a thyroid hormone with
three iodines. Much more commonly, two copies of the second intermediary bond, forming tetraiodothyronine, also
known as thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone with four iodines.

These hormones remain in the colloid center of the thyroid follicles until TSH stimulates endocytosis of colloid back
into the follicle cells. There, lysosomal enzymes break apart the thyroglobulin colloid, releasing free T3 and T4, which
diffuse across the follicle cell membrane and enter the bloodstream.

n the bloodstream, less than one percent of the circulating T3 and T4 remains unbound. This free T3 and T4 can cross
the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and be taken up by cells. The remaining 99 percent of circulating T3 and T4 is bound
to specialized transport proteins called thyroxine-binding globulins (TBGs), to albumin, or to other plasma proteins. This
“packaging” prevents their free diffusion into body cells. When blood levels of T3 and T4 begin to decline, bound T3 and
T4 are released from these plasma proteins and readily cross the membrane of target cells. T3 is more potent than Ta, and
many cells convert T4 to T3 through the removal of an iodine atom.

Regulation of TH Synthesis

The release of T3 and T4 from the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). As shown in Figure
17.13, low blood levels of T3 and Ty stimulate the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus,
which triggers secretion of TSH from the anterior pituitary. In turn, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete T3 and T4.
The levels of TRH, TSH, T3, and Tq are regulated by a negative feedback system in which increasing levels of T3 and T4
decrease the production and secretion of TSH.

Functions of Thyroid Hormones

The thyroid hormones, T3 and Ty, are often referred to as metabolic hormones because their levels influence the body’s
basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy used by the body at rest. When T3 and Ta bind to intracellular receptors located
on the mitochondria, they cause an increase in nutrient breakdown and the use of oxygen to produce ATP. In addition, T3
and Ty initiate the transcription of genes involved in glucose oxidation. Although these mechanisms prompt cells to produce
more ATP, the process is inefficient, and an abnormally increased level of heat is released as a byproduct of these reactions.
This so-called calorigenic effect (calor- = “heat”) raises body temperature.

Adequate levels of thyroid hormones are also required for protein synthesis and for fetal and childhood tissue
development and growth. They are especially critical for normal development of the nervous system both in utero and in
early childhood, and they continue to support neurological function in adults. As noted earlier, these thyroid hormones
have a complex interrelationship with reproductive hormones, and deficiencies can influence libido, fertility, and other
aspects of reproductive function. Finally, thyroid hormones increase the body’s sensitivity to catecholamines (epinephrine
and norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla by upregulation of receptors in the blood vessels. When levels of T3 and
T4 hormones are excessive, this effect accelerates the heart rate, strengthens the heartbeat, and increases blood pressure.
Because thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, heat production, protein synthesis, and many other body functions, thyroid
disorders can have severe and widespread consequences.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 709

isorders OF THE...

Endocrine System: lodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and
Hyperthyroidism

As discussed above, dietary iodine is required for the synthesis of T3 and T4. But for much of the world’s population,
foods do not provide adequate levels of this mineral, because the amount varies according to the level in the soil in
which the food was grown, as well as the irrigation and fertilizers used. Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high
levels because they concentrate iodine from seawater, but many people in landlocked regions lack access to seafood.
Thus, the primary source of dietary iodine in many countries is iodized salt. Fortification of salt with iodine began in
the United States in 1924, and international efforts to iodize salt in the world’s poorest nations continue today.

Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T3 and T4, leading to a variety of
severe disorders. When T3 and T4 cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this
hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The
accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure 17.14).
A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency. Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired growth
and development, decreased fertility, and prenatal and infant death. Moreover, iodine deficiency is the primary cause
of preventable mental retardation worldwide. Neonatal hypothyroidism (cretinism) is characterized by cognitive
deficits, short stature, and sometimes deafness and muteness in children and adults born to mothers who were iodine-
deficient during pregnancy.

Figure 17.14 Goiter (credit: “Almazi"/Wikimedia Commons)

In areas of the world with access to iodized salt, dietary deficiency is rare. Instead, inflammation of the thyroid
gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones. Called hypothyroidism, the condition
is characterized by a low metabolic rate, weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, reduced libido, menstrual
irregularities, and reduced mental activity. In contrast, hyperthyroidism—an abnormally elevated blood level of
thyroid hormones—is often caused by a pituitary or thyroid tumor. In Graves’ disease, the hyperthyroid state results
from an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies overstimulate the follicle cells of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism
can lead to an increased metabolic rate, excessive body heat and sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, tremors, and increased
heart rate. The person’s eyes may bulge (called exophthalmos) as antibodies produce inflammation in the soft tissues
of the orbits. The person may also develop a goiter.

Calcitonin

The thyroid gland also secretes a hormone called calcitonin that is produced by the parafollicular cells (also called C cells)
that stud the tissue between distinct follicles. Calcitonin is released in response to a rise in blood calcium levels. It appears
to have a function in decreasing blood calcium concentrations by:

¢ Inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, bone cells that release calcium into the circulation by degrading bone matrix

¢ Increasing osteoblastic activity

710 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

* Decreasing calcium absorption in the intestines
* Increasing calcium loss in the urine
However, these functions are usually not significant in maintaining calcium homeostasis, so the importance of
calcitonin is not entirely understood. Pharmaceutical preparations of calcitonin are sometimes prescribed to reduce
osteoclast activity in people with osteoporosis and to reduce the degradation of cartilage in people with osteoarthritis. The
hormones secreted by thyroid are summarized in Table 17.4.

Of course, calcium is critical for many other biological processes. It is a second messenger in many signaling pathways,
and is essential for muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. Given these roles, it is not surprising
that blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the endocrine system. The organs involved in the regulation are the
parathyroid glands.

17.5 | The Parathyroid Glands

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the location and structure of the parathyroid glands
* Describe the hormonal control of blood calcium levels
¢ Discuss the physiological response of parathyroid dysfunction

The parathyroid glands are tiny, round structures usually found embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland
(Figure 17.15). A thick connective tissue capsule separates the glands from the thyroid tissue. Most people have four
parathyroid glands, but occasionally there are more in tissues of the neck or chest. The function of one type of parathyroid
cells, the oxyphil cells, is not clear. The primary functional cells of the parathyroid glands are the chief cells. These epithelial
cells produce and secrete the parathyroid hormone (PTH), the major hormone involved in the regulation of blood calcium
levels.

The parathyroid glands produce and secrete PTH, a peptide hormone, in response to low blood calcium levels (Figure
17.16). PTH secretion causes the release of calcium from the bones by stimulating osteoclasts, which secrete enzymes
that degrade bone and release calcium into the interstitial fluid. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone
deposition, thereby sparing blood calcium. PTH causes increased reabsorption of calcium (and magnesium) in the kidney
tubules from the urine filtrate. In addition, PTH initiates the production of the steroid hormone calcitriol (also known as
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which is the active form of vitamin D3, in the kidneys. Calcitriol then stimulates increased
absorption of dietary calcium by the intestines. A negative feedback loop regulates the levels of PTH, with rising blood
calcium levels inhibiting further release of PTH.

Figure 17.16 Parathyroid Hormone in Maintaining Blood Calcium Homeostasis Parathyroid hormone increases
blood calcium levels when they drop too low. Conversely, calcitonin, which is released from the thyroid gland,
decreases blood calcium levels when they become too high. These two mechanisms constantly maintain blood calcium
concentration at homeostasis.

Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland can cause hyperparathyroidism, a disorder caused by an
overproduction of PTH that results in excessive calcium reabsorption from bone. Hyperparathyroidism can significantly
decrease bone density, leading to spontaneous fractures or deformities. As blood calcium levels rise, cell membrane
permeability to sodium is decreased, and the responsiveness of the nervous system is reduced. At the same time, calcium
deposits may collect in the body’s tissues and organs, impairing their functioning.

In contrast, abnormally low blood calcium levels may be caused by parathyroid hormone deficiency, called
hypoparathyroidism, which may develop following injury or surgery involving the thyroid gland. Low blood calcium
increases membrane permeability to sodium, resulting in muscle twitching, cramping, spasms, or convulsions. Severe
deficits can paralyze muscles, including those involved in breathing, and can be fatal.

When blood calcium levels are high, calcitonin is produced and secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland.
As discussed earlier, calcitonin inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, reduces the absorption of dietary calcium in the intestine,
and signals the kidneys to reabsorb less calcium, resulting in larger amounts of calcium excreted in the urine.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the location and structure of the adrenal glands

effects

The adrenal glands are wedges of glandular and neuroendocrine tissue adhering to the top of the kidneys by a fibrous
capsule (Figure 17.17). The adrenal glands have a rich blood supply and experience one of the highest rates of blood flow
in the body. They are served by several arteries branching off the aorta, including the suprarenal and renal arteries. Blood
flows to each adrenal gland at the adrenal cortex and then drains into the adrenal medulla. Adrenal hormones are released
into the circulation via the left and right suprarenal veins.

which produce different types of hormones. LM x 204. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan

in greater detail.

The adrenal gland consists of an outer cortex of glandular tissue and an inner medulla of nervous tissue. The cortex
itself is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata, and the zona reticularis. Each region secretes
its own set of hormones.

The adrenal cortex, as a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, secretes steroid hormones
important for the regulation of the long-term stress response, blood pressure and blood volume, nutrient uptake and
storage, fluid and electrolyte balance, and inflammation. The HPA axis involves the stimulation of hormone release of
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary by the hypothalamus. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to
produce the hormone cortisol. This pathway will be discussed in more detail below.

The adrenal medulla is neuroendocrine tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
neurons. It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates homeostasis in the body. The
sympathomedullary (SAM) pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the hypothalamus via
neurons from the thoracic spinal cord. The medulla is stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and
norepinephrine.

713

714 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

One of the major functions of the adrenal gland is to respond to stress. Stress can be either physical or psychological
or both. Physical stresses include exposing the body to injury, walking outside in cold and wet conditions without a coat on,
or malnutrition. Psychological stresses include the perception of a physical threat, a fight with a loved one, or just a bad day
at school.

The body responds in different ways to short-term stress and long-term stress following a pattern known as the general
adaptation syndrome (GAS). Stage one of GAS is called the alarm reaction. This is short-term stress, the fight-or-flight
response, mediated by the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla via the SAM pathway. Their
function is to prepare the body for extreme physical exertion. Once this stress is relieved, the body quickly returns to normal.
The section on the adrenal medulla covers this response in more detail.

If the stress is not soon relieved, the body adapts to the stress in the second stage called the stage of resistance. If
a person is starving for example, the body may send signals to the gastrointestinal tract to maximize the absorption of
nutrients from food.

If the stress continues for a longer term however, the body responds with symptoms quite different than the fight-
or-flight response. During the stage of exhaustion, individuals may begin to suffer depression, the suppression of their
immune response, severe fatigue, or even a fatal heart attack. These symptoms are mediated by the hormones of the adrenal
cortex, especially cortisol, released as a result of signals from the HPA axis.

Adrenal hormones also have several non-stress-related functions, including the increase of blood sodium and glucose
levels, which will be described in detail below.

Adrenal Cortex

The adrenal cortex consists of multiple layers of lipid-storing cells that occur in three structurally distinct regions. Each of
these regions produces different hormones.

@- Interactive LINK

Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/adrenalglands) to view an animation describing the location and function
of the adrenal glands. Which hormone produced by the adrenal glands is responsible for the mobilization of energy
stores?

Hormones of the Zona Glomerulosa

The most superficial region of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa, which produces a group of hormones collectively
referred to as mineralocorticoids because of their effect on body minerals, especially sodium and potassium. These
hormones are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance.

Aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid. It is important in the regulation of the concentration of sodium and

potassium ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. For example, it is released in response to elevated blood K’, low blood Na’, low

blood pressure, or low blood volume. In response, aldosterone increases the excretion of K* and the retention of Na‘, which
in turn increases blood volume and blood pressure. Its secretion is prompted when CRH from the hypothalamus triggers
ACTH release from the anterior pituitary.

Aldosterone is also a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in which specialized cells
of the kidneys secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure. Renin then catalyzes
the conversion of the blood protein angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to the hormone angiotensin I. Angiotensin
I is converted in the lungs to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II has three major
functions:

1. Initiating vasoconstriction of the arterioles, decreasing blood flow

2. Stimulating kidney tubules to reabsorb NaCl and water, increasing blood volume

3. Signaling the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, the effects of which further contribute to fluid retention, restoring
blood pressure and blood volume

For individuals with hypertension, or high blood pressure, drugs are available that block the production of angiotensin
Il. These drugs, known as ACE inhibitors, block the ACE enzyme from converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus
mitigating the latter’s ability to increase blood pressure.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 715

Hormones of the Zona Fasciculata

The intermediate region of the adrenal cortex is the zona fasciculata, named as such because the cells form small fascicles
(bundles) separated by tiny blood vessels. The cells of the zona fasciculata produce hormones called glucocorticoids
because of their role in glucose metabolism. The most important of these is cortisol, some of which the liver converts
to cortisone. A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is corticosterone. In response to long-term stressors,
the hypothalamus secretes CRH, which in turn triggers the release of ACTH by the anterior pituitary. ACTH triggers the
release of the glucocorticoids. Their overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while stimulating the breakdown of stored
nutrients to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In conditions of long-term stress, for example, cortisol promotes the catabolism
of glycogen to glucose, the catabolism of stored triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, and the catabolism of muscle
proteins into amino acids. These raw materials can then be used to synthesize additional glucose and ketones for use as body
uels. The hippocampus, which is part of the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortices and important in memory formation, is
highly sensitive to stress levels because of its many glucocorticoid receptors.

You are probably familiar with prescription and over-the-counter medications containing glucocorticoids, such as
cortisone injections into inflamed joints, prednisone tablets and steroid-based inhalers used to manage severe asthma, and
hydrocortisone creams applied to relieve itchy skin rashes. These drugs reflect another role of cortisol—the downregulation
of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory response.

Hormones of the Zona Reticularis

The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex
hormones called androgens. During puberty and most of adulthood, androgens are produced in the gonads. The androgens
produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to ACTH from the
anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or estrogens. In adult women, they may contribute to the
sex drive, but their function in adult men is not well understood. In post-menopausal women, as the functions of the ovaries
decline, the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis.

Adrenal Medulla

As noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in response to long-term stress such as severe illness. In
contrast, the adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term stress mediated by the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS).

The medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons called chromaffin cells, which are large
and irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or
noradrenaline). Epinephrine is produced in greater quantities—approximately a 4 to 1 ratio with norepinephrine—and is the
more powerful hormone. Because the chromaffin cells release epinephrine and norepinephrine into the systemic circulation,
where they travel widely and exert effects on distant cells, they are considered hormones. Derived from the amino acid
tyrosine, they are chemically classified as catecholamines.

The secretion of medullary epinephrine and norepinephrine is controlled by a neural pathway that originates from the
hypothalamus in response to danger or stress (the SAM pathway). Both epinephrine and norepinephrine signal the liver and
skeletal muscle cells to convert glycogen into glucose, resulting in increased blood glucose levels. These hormones increase
the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to prepare the body to fight the perceived threat or flee from it. In addition, the
pathway dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels. It also prompts vasodilation, further increasing the oxygenation
of important organs such as the lungs, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. At the same time, it triggers vasoconstriction to
blood vessels serving less essential organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skin, and downregulates some
components of the immune system. Other effects include a dry mouth, loss of appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of
peripheral vision. The major hormones of the adrenal glands are summarized in Table 17.5.

Table 17.5

Disorders Involving the Adrenal Glands

Several disorders are caused by the dysregulation of the hormones produced by the adrenal glands. For example, Cushing’s
disease is a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels and the accumulation of lipid deposits on the face and neck.
It is caused by hypersecretion of cortisol. The most common source of Cushing’s disease is a pituitary tumor that secretes

716 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

cortisol or ACTH in abnormally high amounts. Other common signs of Cushing’s disease include the development of a
moon-shaped face, a buffalo hump on the back of the neck, rapid weight gain, and hair loss. Chronically elevated glucose
levels are also associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition to hyperglycemia, chronically
elevated glucocorticoids compromise immunity, resistance to infection, and memory, and can result in rapid weight gain
and hair loss.

In contrast, the hyposecretion of corticosteroids can result in Addison’s disease, a rare disorder that causes low blood
glucose levels and low blood sodium levels. The signs and symptoms of Addison’s disease are vague and are typical of other
disorders as well, making diagnosis difficult. They may include general weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea,
vomiting, sweating, and cravings for salty food.

17.7 | The Pineal Gland

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland
* Discuss the function of melatonin

Recall that the hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon of the brain, sits inferior and somewhat anterior to the thalamus.
Inferior but somewhat posterior to the thalamus is the pineal gland, a tiny endocrine gland whose functions are not entirely
clear. The pinealocyte cells that make up the pineal gland are known to produce and secrete the amine hormone melatonin,
which is derived from serotonin.

The secretion of melatonin varies according to the level of light received from the environment. When photons of light
stimulate the retinas of the eyes, a nerve impulse is sent to a region of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN), which is important in regulating biological rhythms. From the SCN, the nerve signal is carried to the spinal cord and
eventually to the pineal gland, where the production of melatonin is inhibited. As a result, blood levels of melatonin fall,
promoting wakefulness. In contrast, as light levels decline—such as during the evening—melatonin production increases,
boosting blood levels and causing drowsiness.

melatonin. What should you avoid doing in the middle of your sleep cycle that would lower melatonin?

The secretion of melatonin may influence the body’s circadian rhythms, the dark-light fluctuations that affect not only
sleepiness and wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature. Interestingly, children have higher melatonin levels
than adults, which may prevent the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby inhibiting the onset of
puberty. Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the subject of current research.

Jet lag occurs when a person travels across several time zones and feels sleepy during the day or wakeful at night.
Traveling across multiple time zones significantly disturbs the light-dark cycle regulated by melatonin. It can take up to
several days for melatonin synthesis to adjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment, resulting in jet lag. Some
air travelers take melatonin supplements to induce sleep.

17.8 | Gonadal and Placental Hormones

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the most important hormones produced by the testes and ovaries
¢ Name the hormones produced by the placenta and state their functions

This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 717

This section briefly discusses the hormonal role of the gonads—the male testes and female ovaries—which produce the sex
cells (sperm and ova) and secrete the gonadal hormones. The roles of the gonadotropins released from the anterior pituitary
(FSH and LH) were discussed earlier.

The primary hormone produced by the male testes is testosterone, a steroid hormone important in the development of
the male reproductive system, the maturation of sperm cells, and the development of male secondary sex characteristics such
as a deepened voice, body hair, and increased muscle mass. Interestingly, testosterone is also produced in the female ovaries,
but at a much reduced level. In addition, the testes produce the peptide hormone inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of
FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis.

The primary hormones produced by the ovaries are estrogens, which include estradiol, estriol, and estrone. Estrogens
play an important role in a larger number of physiological processes, including the development of the female reproductive
system, regulation of the menstrual cycle, the development of female secondary sex characteristics such as increased
adipose tissue and the development of breast tissue, and the maintenance of pregnancy. Another significant ovarian hormone
is progesterone, which contributes to regulation of the menstrual cycle and is important in preparing the body for pregnancy
as well as maintaining pregnancy. In addition, the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles produce inhibin, which—as in
males—inhibits the secretion of FSH.During the initial stages of pregnancy, an organ called the placenta develops within
the uterus. The placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, excretes waste products, and produces and secretes
estrogens and progesterone. The placenta produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as well. The hCG hormone
promotes progesterone synthesis and reduces the mother’s immune function to protect the fetus from immune rejection. It
also secretes human placental lactogen (hPL), which plays a role in preparing the breasts for lactation, and relaxin, which is
thought to help soften and widen the pubic symphysis in preparation for childbirth. The hormones controlling reproduction
are summarized in Table 17.6.

Everyday CONNECTION

Anabolic Steroids

The endocrine system can be exploited for illegal or unethical purposes. A prominent example of this is the use of
steroid drugs by professional athletes.

Commonly used for performance enhancement, anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of the male sex hormone,
testosterone. By boosting natural levels of this hormone, athletes experience increased muscle mass. Synthetic versions
of human growth hormone are also used to build muscle mass.

The use of performance-enhancing drugs is banned by all major collegiate and professional sports organizations
in the United States because they impart an unfair advantage to athletes who take them. In addition, the drugs can
cause significant and dangerous side effects. For example, anabolic steroid use can increase cholesterol levels, raise
blood pressure, and damage the liver. Altered testosterone levels (both too low or too high) have been implicated in
causing structural damage to the heart, and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks, congestive heart
failure, and sudden death. Paradoxically, steroids can have a feminizing effect in males, including shriveled testicles
and enlarged breast tissue. In females, their use can cause masculinizing effects such as an enlarged clitoris and growth
of facial hair. In both sexes, their use can promote increased aggression (commonly known as “roid-rage”), depression,
sleep disturbances, severe acne, and infertility.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Compare and contrast the functions of insulin and glucagon

The pancreas is a long, slender organ, most of which is located posterior to the bottom half of the stomach (Figure 17.18).
Although it is primarily an exocrine gland, secreting a variety of digestive enzymes, the pancreas has an endocrine function.
Its pancreatic islets—clusters of cells formerly known as the islets of Langerhans—secrete the hormones glucagon, insulin,
somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).

Cells and Secretions of the Pancreatic Islets

The pancreatic islets each contain four varieties of cells:
* The alpha cell produces the hormone glucagon and makes up approximately 20 percent of each islet. Glucagon plays
an important role in blood glucose regulation; low blood glucose levels stimulate its release.
* The beta cell produces the hormone insulin and makes up approximately 75 percent of each islet. Elevated blood
glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 719

* The delta cell accounts for four percent of the islet cells and secretes the peptide hormone somatostatin. Recall that
somatostatin is also released by the hypothalamus (as GHIH), and the stomach and intestines also secrete it. An
inhibiting hormone, pancreatic somatostatin inhibits the release of both glucagon and insulin.

¢ The PP cell accounts for about one percent of islet cells and secretes the pancreatic polypeptide hormone. It is thought
to play a role in appetite, as well as in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine secretions. Pancreatic
polypeptide released following a meal may reduce further food consumption; however, it is also released in response
to fasting.

Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon

Glucose is required for cellular respiration and is the preferred fuel for all body cells. The body derives glucose from the
breakdown of the carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks we consume. Glucose not immediately taken up by cells for fuel
can be stored by the liver and muscles as glycogen, or converted to triglycerides and stored in the adipose tissue. Hormones
regulate both the storage and the utilization of glucose as required. Receptors located in the pancreas sense blood glucose
levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels.

Glucagon

Receptors in the pancreas can sense the decline in blood glucose levels, such as during periods of fasting or during
prolonged labor or exercise (Figure 17.19). In response, the alpha cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone glucagon,
which has several effects:

* It stimulates the liver to convert its stores of glycogen back into glucose. This response is known as glycogenolysis.
The glucose is then released into the circulation for use by body cells.

* It stimulates the liver to take up amino acids from the blood and convert them into glucose. This response is known as
gluconeogenesis.

* Itstimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. Some of the free glycerol
released into the bloodstream travels to the liver, which converts it into glucose. This is also a form of gluconeogenesis.
Taken together, these actions increase blood glucose levels. The activity of glucagon is regulated through a negative

feedback mechanism; rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon production and secretion.

Figure 17.19 Homeostatic Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels Blood glucose concentration is tightly maintained
between 70 mg/dL and 110 mg/dL. If blood glucose concentration rises above this range, insulin is released, which
stimulates body cells to remove glucose from the blood. If blood glucose concentration drops below this range,
glucagon is released, which stimulates body cells to release glucose into the blood.

Insulin

The primary function of insulin is to facilitate the uptake of glucose into body cells. Red blood cells, as well as cells of
the brain, liver, kidneys, and the lining of the small intestine, do not have insulin receptors on their cell membranes and do
not require insulin for glucose uptake. Although all other body cells do require insulin if they are to take glucose from the
bloodstream, skeletal muscle cells and adipose cells are the primary targets of insulin.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 721

The presence of food in the intestine triggers the release of gastrointestinal tract hormones such as glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide (previously known as gastric inhibitory peptide). This is in turn the initial trigger for insulin
production and secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas. Once nutrient absorption occurs, the resulting surge in blood
glucose levels further stimulates insulin secretion.

Precisely how insulin facilitates glucose uptake is not entirely clear. However, insulin appears to activate a tyrosine
kinase receptor, triggering the phosphorylation of many substrates within the cell. These multiple biochemical reactions
converge to support the movement of intracellular vesicles containing facilitative glucose transporters to the cell membrane.
In the absence of insulin, these transport proteins are normally recycled slowly between the cell membrane and cell interior.
Insulin triggers the rapid movement of a pool of glucose transporter vesicles to the cell membrane, where they fuse and
expose the glucose transporters to the extracellular fluid. The transporters then move glucose by facilitated diffusion into
the cell interior.

Visit this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/pancreas1) to view an animation describing the location and function of
the pancreas. What goes wrong in the function of insulin in type 2 diabetes?

Insulin also reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating glycolysis, the metabolism of glucose for generation of ATP.
Moreover, it stimulates the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage, and it inhibits enzymes involved in
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Finally, insulin promotes triglyceride and protein synthesis. The secretion of insulin
is regulated through a negative feedback mechanism. As blood glucose levels decrease, further insulin release is inhibited.
The pancreatic hormones are summarized in Table 17.7.

isorders |OF THE...

Endocrine System: Diabetes Mellitus

Dysfunction of insulin production and secretion, as well as the target cells’ responsiveness to insulin, can lead to a
condition called diabetes mellitus. An increasingly common disease, diabetes mellitus has been diagnosed in more
than 18 million adults in the United States, and more than 200,000 children. It is estimated that up to 7 million more
adults have the condition but have not been diagnosed. In addition, approximately 79 million people in the US are
estimated to have pre-diabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are abnormally high, but not yet high enough
to be classified as diabetes.

There are two main forms of diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease affecting the beta cells
of the pancreas. Certain genes are recognized to increase susceptibility. The beta cells of people with type 1 diabetes
do not produce insulin; thus, synthetic insulin must be administered by injection or infusion. This form of diabetes
accounts for less than five percent of all diabetes cases.

Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95 percent of all cases. It is acquired, and lifestyle factors such as
poor diet, inactivity, and the presence of pre-diabetes greatly increase a person’s risk. About 80 to 90 percent of people
with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. In type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. In
response, the pancreas increases its insulin secretion, but over time, the beta cells become exhausted. In many cases,
type 2 diabetes can be reversed by moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and consumption of a healthy diet;
however, if blood glucose levels cannot be controlled, the diabetic will eventually require insulin.

Two of the early manifestations of diabetes are excessive urination and excessive thirst. They demonstrate how the
out-of-control levels of glucose in the blood affect kidney function. The kidneys are responsible for filtering glucose
from the blood. Excessive blood glucose draws water into the urine, and as a result the person eliminates an abnormally
large quantity of sweet urine. The use of body water to dilute the urine leaves the body dehydrated, and so the person is
unusually and continually thirsty. The person may also experience persistent hunger because the body cells are unable
to access the glucose in the bloodstream.

Over time, persistently high levels of glucose in the blood injure tissues throughout the body, especially those of
the blood vessels and nerves. Inflammation and injury of the lining of arteries lead to atherosclerosis and an increased
risk of heart attack and stroke. Damage to the microscopic blood vessels of the kidney impairs kidney function and
can lead to kidney failure. Damage to blood vessels that serve the eyes can lead to blindness. Blood vessel damage
also reduces circulation to the limbs, whereas nerve damage leads to a loss of sensation, called neuropathy, particularly
in the hands and feet. Together, these changes increase the risk of injury, infection, and tissue death (necrosis),
contributing to a high rate of toe, foot, and lower leg amputations in people with diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can
also lead to a dangerous form of metabolic acidosis called ketoacidosis. Deprived of glucose, cells increasingly rely
on fat stores for fuel. However, in a glucose-deficient state, the liver is forced to use an alternative lipid metabolism
pathway that results in the increased production of ketone bodies (or ketones), which are acidic. The build-up of
ketones in the blood causes ketoacidosis, which—if left untreated—may lead to a life-threatening “diabetic coma.”
Together, these complications make diabetes the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.

Diabetes is diagnosed when lab tests reveal that blood glucose levels are higher than normal, a condition called
hyperglycemia. The treatment of diabetes depends on the type, the severity of the condition, and the ability of the
patient to make lifestyle changes. As noted earlier, moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and consumption
of a healthful diet can reduce blood glucose levels. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may be unable to control their
disease with these lifestyle changes, and will require medication. Historically, the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes
was insulin. Research advances have resulted in alternative options, including medications that enhance pancreatic
function.

17.10 | Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the organs with a secondary endocrine function, the hormone they produce, and its effects

In your study of anatomy and physiology, you have already encountered a few of the many organs of the body that have
secondary endocrine functions. Here, you will learn about the hormone-producing activities of the heart, gastrointestinal
tract, kidneys, skeleton, adipose tissue, skin, and thymus.

Heart

When the body experiences an increase in blood volume or pressure, the cells of the heart’s atrial wall stretch. In response,
specialized cells in the wall of the atria produce and secrete the peptide hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP
signals the kidneys to reduce sodium reabsorption, thereby decreasing the amount of water reabsorbed from the urine filtrate
and reducing blood volume. Other actions of ANP include the inhibition of renin secretion and the initiation of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and vasodilation. Therefore, ANP aids in decreasing blood pressure, blood volume,
and blood sodium levels.

Gastrointestinal Tract

The endocrine cells of the GI tract are located in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine. Some of these hormones
are secreted in response to eating a meal and aid in digestion. An example of a hormone secreted by the stomach cells
is gastrin, a peptide hormone secreted in response to stomach distention that stimulates the release of hydrochloric acid.
Secretin is a peptide hormone secreted by the small intestine as acidic chyme (partially digested food and fluid) moves from
the stomach. It stimulates the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas, which buffers the acidic chyme, and inhibits the
further secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is another peptide hormone released from the
small intestine. It promotes the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and the release of bile from the gallbladder, both of which
facilitate digestion. Other hormones produced by the intestinal cells aid in glucose metabolism, such as by stimulating the
pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin, reducing glucagon secretion from the alpha cells, or enhancing cellular sensitivity to
insulin.

Kidneys

The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood flow to
the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and
stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure. The kidneys
also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D3, which is released
in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin
(EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone
marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a
synthetic form).

Skeleton

Although bone has long been recognized as a target for hormones, only recently have researchers recognized that the
skeleton itself produces at least two hormones. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced by bone cells in response

724 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

to increased blood levels of vitamin D3 or phosphate. It triggers the kidneys to inhibit the formation of calcitriol from
vitamin D3 and to increase phosphorus excretion. Osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts, stimulates the pancreatic beta cells
to increase insulin production. It also acts on peripheral tissues to increase their sensitivity to insulin and their utilization of
glucose.

Adipose Tissue

Adipose tissue produces and secretes several hormones involved in lipid metabolism and storage. One important example is
leptin, a protein manufactured by adipose cells that circulates in amounts directly proportional to levels of body fat. Leptin
is released in response to food consumption and acts by binding to brain neurons involved in energy intake and expenditure.
Binding of leptin produces a feeling of satiety after a meal, thereby reducing appetite. It also appears that the binding of
leptin to brain receptors triggers the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism, increasing deposition of
cortical bone. Adiponectin—another hormone synthesized by adipose cells—appears to reduce cellular insulin resistance
and to protect blood vessels from inflammation and atherosclerosis. Its levels are lower in people who are obese, and rise
following weight loss.

Skin

The skin functions as an endocrine organ in the production of the inactive form of vitamin D3, cholecalciferol. When
cholesterol present in the epidermis is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, it is converted to cholecalciferol, which then enters
the blood. In the liver, cholecalciferol is converted to an intermediate that travels to the kidneys and is further converted to
calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3. Vitamin D is important in a variety of physiological processes, including intestinal
calcium absorption and immune system function. In some studies, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with
increased risks of cancer, severe asthma, and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, and in
adults, osteomalacia—both of which are characterized by bone deterioration.

Thymus

The thymus is an organ of the immune system that is larger and more active during infancy and early childhood, and begins
to atrophy as we age. Its endocrine function is the production of a group of hormones called thymosins that contribute to
the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes, which are immune cells. Although the role of thymosins is not yet
well understood, it is clear that they contribute to the immune response. Thymosins have been found in tissues other than
the thymus and have a wide variety of functions, so the thymosins cannot be strictly categorized as thymic hormones.

Liver

The liver is responsible for secreting at least four important hormones or hormone precursors: insulin-like growth factor
(somatomedin), angiotensinogen, thrombopoetin, and hepcidin. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is the immediate stimulus for
growth in the body, especially of the bones. Angiotensinogen is the precursor to angiotensin, mentioned earlier, which
increases blood pressure. Thrombopoetin stimulates the production of the blood’s platelets. Hepcidins block the release of
iron from cells in the body, helping to regulate iron homeostasis in our body fluids. The major hormones of these other
organs are summarized in Table 17.8.

17.11 | Development and Aging of the Endocrine System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the embryonic origins of the endocrine system
¢ Discuss the effects of aging on the endocrine system

The endocrine system arises from all three embryonic germ layers. The endocrine glands that produce the steroid hormones,
such as the gonads and adrenal cortex, arise from the mesoderm. In contrast, endocrine glands that arise from the endoderm
and ectoderm produce the amine, peptide, and protein hormones. The pituitary gland arises from two distinct areas of the
ectoderm: the anterior pituitary gland arises from the oral ectoderm, whereas the posterior pituitary gland arises from the
neural ectoderm at the base of the hypothalamus. The pineal gland also arises from the ectoderm. The two structures o
the adrenal glands arise from two different germ layers: the adrenal cortex from the mesoderm and the adrenal medulla
from ectoderm neural cells. The endoderm gives rise to the thyroid and parathyroid glands, as well as the pancreas and the
thymus.

As the body ages, changes occur that affect the endocrine system, sometimes altering the production, secretion, and
catabolism of hormones. For example, the structure of the anterior pituitary gland changes as vascularization decreases and
the connective tissue content increases with increasing age. This restructuring affects the gland’s hormone production. For
example, the amount of human growth hormone that is produced declines with age, resulting in the reduced muscle mass
commonly observed in the elderly.

The adrenal glands also undergo changes as the body ages; as fibrous tissue increases, the production of cortiso!
and aldosterone decreases. Interestingly, the production and secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine remain norma!
throughout the aging process.

A well-known example of the aging process affecting an endocrine gland is menopause and the decline of ovarian
‘unction. With increasing age, the ovaries decrease in both size and weight and become progressively less sensitive to
gonadotropins. This gradually causes a decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels, leading to menopause and the inability
to reproduce. Low levels of estrogens and progesterone are also associated with some disease states, such as osteoporosis,
atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia, or abnormal blood lipid levels.

Testosterone levels also decline with age, a condition called andropause (or viropause); however, this decline is much
less dramatic than the decline of estrogens in women, and much more gradual, rarely affecting sperm production until
very old age. Although this means that males maintain their ability to father children for decades longer than females, the
quantity, quality, and motility of their sperm is often reduced.
As the body ages, the thyroid gland produces less of the thyroid hormones, causing a gradual decrease in the basal
metabolic rate. The lower metabolic rate reduces the production of body heat and increases levels of body fat. Parathyroid
hormones, on the other hand, increase with age. This may be because of reduced dietary calcium levels, causing a
compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone. However, increased parathyroid hormone levels combined with decreased

725

726 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

levels of calcitonin (and estrogens in women) can lead to osteoporosis as PTH stimulates demineralization of bones to
increase blood calcium levels. Notice that osteoporosis is common in both elderly males and females.

Increasing age also affects glucose metabolism, as blood glucose levels spike more rapidly and take longer to return to
normal in the elderly. In addition, increasing glucose intolerance may occur because of a gradual decline in cellular insulin
sensitivity. Almost 27 percent of Americans aged 65 and older have diabetes.

CHAPTER REVIEW

17.1 An Overview of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones critical to homeostasis. The body
coordinates its functions through two major types of communication: neural and endocrine. Neural communication includes
both electrical and chemical signaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine communication involves chemical
signaling via the release of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and
may travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a response in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless glands that
secrete hormones. Many organs of the body with other primary functions—such as the heart, stomach, and kidneys—also
have hormone-secreting cells.

17.2 Hormones

Hormones are derived from amino acids or lipids. Amine hormones originate from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine.
Larger amino acid hormones include peptides and protein hormones. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol.
Steroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. All other amino acid—derived hormones are water soluble.
Hydrophobic hormones are able to diffuse through the membrane and interact with an intracellular receptor. In contrast,
hydrophilic hormones must interact with cell membrane receptors. These are typically associated with a G protein, which
becomes activated when the hormone binds the receptor. This initiates a signaling cascade that involves a second messenger,
such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Second messenger systems greatly amplify the hormone signal, creating
a broader, more efficient, and faster response.
Hormones are released upon stimulation that is of either chemical or neural origin. Regulation of hormone release is
primarily achieved through negative feedback. Various stimuli may cause the release of hormones, but there are three major

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 731

types. Humoral stimuli are changes in ion or nutrient levels in the blood. Hormonal stimuli are changes in hormone levels
that initiate or inhibit the secretion of another hormone. Finally, a neural stimulus occurs when a nerve impulse prompts the
secretion or inhibition of a hormone.

17.3 The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus-pituitary complex is located in the diencephalon of the brain. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland
are connected by a structure called the infundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve axons. The pituitary gland
is divided into two distinct structures with different embryonic origins. The posterior lobe houses the axon terminals of
hypothalamic neurons. It stores and releases into the bloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin and antidiuretic
hormone (ADH). The anterior lobe is connected to the hypothalamus by vasculature in the infundibulum and produces and
secretes six hormones. Their secretion is regulated, however, by releasing and inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus.
The six anterior pituitary hormones are: growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL).

17.4 The Thyroid Gland

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the neck anterior to the trachea. Its hormones regulate basa
metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism, the production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis. They also contribute to
protein synthesis and the normal growth and development of body tissues, including maturation of the nervous system, and
they increase the body’s sensitivity to catecholamines. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are
produced and secreted by the thyroid gland in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary.
Synthesis of the amino acid-derived T3 and T4 hormones requires iodine. Insufficient amounts of iodine in the diet can lead
to goiter, cretinism, and many other disorders.

17.5 The Parathyroid Glands

Calcium is required for a variety of important physiologic processes, including neuromuscular functioning; thus, blood
calcium levels are closely regulated. The parathyroid glands are small structures located on the posterior thyroid gland that
produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates blood calcium levels. Low blood calcium levels cause the production
and secretion of PTH. In contrast, elevated blood calcium levels inhibit secretion of PTH and trigger secretion of the thyroid
hormone calcitonin. Underproduction of PTH can result in hypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of PTH can
result in hyperparathyroidism.

17.6 The Adrenal Glands

The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The
adrenal cortex—the outer layer of the gland—produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The adrenal
medulla at the core of the gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress response and a long-term stress response. A perceived threat results in
the secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which mediate the fight-or-flight response. The
long-term stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in
turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from the adrenal cortex. The mineralocorticoids, chiefly aldosterone, cause
sodium and fluid retention, which increases blood volume and blood pressure.

17.7 The Pineal Gland

The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the diencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and posterior to the
thalamus. It is made up of pinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the hormone melatonin in response to low light
levels. High blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet lag, caused by traveling across several time zones, occurs
because melatonin synthesis takes several days to readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment.

17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones

The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
(LH) produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the
hypothalamus. In males, FSH stimulates sperm maturation, which is inhibited by the hormone inhibin. The steroid hormone
testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of
the male reproductive system, as well as the development of male secondary sex characteristics. In females, FSH promotes
egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these
hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining
pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the
pregnancy.

732 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas

The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The pancreatic islet cell types include alpha cells, which produce
glucagon; beta cells, which produce insulin; delta cells, which produce somatostatin; and PP cells, which produce pancreatic
polypeptide. Insulin and glucagon are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin is produced by the beta cells
in response to high blood glucose levels. It enhances glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, as well as the storage of
excess glucose for later use. Dysfunction of the production of insulin or target cell resistance to the effects of insulin causes
diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. The hormone glucagon is produced and secreted
by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates mechanisms that increase
blood glucose levels, such as the catabolism of glycogen into glucose.

17.10 Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions

Some organs have a secondary endocrine function. For example, the walls of the atria of the heart produce the hormone
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the gastrointestinal tract produces the hormones gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin,
which aid in digestion, and the kidneys produce erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the formation of red blood cells.
Even bone, adipose tissue, and the skin have secondary endocrine functions.

17.11 Development and Aging of the Endocrine System

The endocrine system originates from all three germ layers of the embryo, including the endoderm, ectoderm, and
mesoderm. In general, different hormone classes arise from distinct germ layers. Aging affects the endocrine glands,
potentially affecting hormone production and secretion, and can cause disease. The production of hormones, such as human
growth hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones, and the thyroid hormones, decreases with age.

738 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

Single-celled organisms do not need blood. They obtain nutrients directly from and excrete wastes directly into their
environment. The human organism cannot do that. Our large, complex bodies need blood to deliver nutrients to and remove
wastes from our trillions of cells. The heart pumps blood throughout the body in a network of blood vessels. Together, these
three components—blood, heart, and vessels—makes up the cardiovascular system. This chapter focuses on the medium of
transport: blood.

18.1 | An Overview of Blood

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the primary functions of blood in transportation, defense, and maintenance of homeostasis

* Name the fluid component of blood and the three major types of formed elements, and identify their relative
proportions in a blood sample

¢ Discuss the unique physical characteristics of blood
¢ Identify the composition of blood plasma, including its most important solutes and plasma proteins

Recall that blood is a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an extracellular
matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as the formed elements—include red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and cell fragments called platelets. The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes blood unique among
connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and
enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.

Functions of Blood

The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is only
the beginning of the story. The specific functions of blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and maintenance of
homeostasis.

Transportation

utrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract. Most of these travel in the bloodstream directly to the
liver, where they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery to body cells. Oxygen from the air you
breathe diffuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart, which then pumps it out to the rest of the body.
Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream,
which carries them to distant target cells. Blood also picks up cellular wastes and byproducts, and transports them to various
organs for removal. For instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation from the body, and various waste
products are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion from the body in the form of urine or bile.

Defense

Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the
bloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that could
multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.

When damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and certain proteins dissolved in the plasma, the fluid
portion of the blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels involved. This protects the body from further
blood loss.

Maintenance of Homeostasis

Recall that body temperature is regulated via a classic negative-feedback loop. If you were exercising on a warm day, your
rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic mechanisms, including increased transport of blood from
your core to your body periphery, which is typically cooler. As blood passes through the vessels of the skin, heat would be
dissipated to the environment, and the blood returning to your body core would be cooler. In contrast, on a cold day, blood
is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer body core. In extreme cases, this may result in frostbite.

Blood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body. Proteins and other compounds in blood act as buffers,
which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the water content of body cells.

Composition of Blood

You have probably had blood drawn from a superficial vein in your arm, which was then sent to a lab for analysis. Some of
the most common blood tests—for instance, those measuring lipid or glucose levels in plasma—determine which substances
are present within blood and in what quantities. Other blood tests check for the composition of the blood itself, including
the quantities and types of formed elements.

One such test, called a hematocrit, measures the percentage of RBCs, clinically known as erythrocytes, in a blood
sample. It is performed by spinning the blood sample in a specialized centrifuge, a process that causes the heavier elements

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 739

suspended within the blood sample to separate from the lightweight, liquid plasma (Figure 18.2). Because the heaviest
elements in blood are the erythrocytes, these settle at the very bottom of the hematocrit tube. Located above the erythrocytes
is a pale, thin layer composed of the remaining formed elements of blood. These are the WBCs, clinically known as
leukocytes, and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes. This layer is referred to as the buffy coat because of
its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood sample. Above the buffy coat is the blood plasma, normally
a pale, straw-colored fluid, which constitutes the remainder of the sample.

The volume of erythrocytes after centrifugation is also commonly referred to as packed cell volume (PCV). In normal
blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly, however,
about 36-50 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit values for females range from 37 to 47,
with a mean value of 41; for males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to 52, with a mean of 47. The percentage of other formed
elements, the WBCs and platelets, is extremely small so it is not normally considered with the hematocrit. So the mean
plasma percentage is the percent of blood that is not erythrocytes: for females, it is approximately 59 (or 100 minus 41), and
for males, it is approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).

Figure 18.2 Composition of Blood The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and
comparatively fewer leukocytes and platelets. Plasma is the fluid in which the formed elements are suspended. A
sample of blood spun in a centrifuge reveals that plasma is the lightest component. It floats at the top of the tube
separated from the heaviest elements, the erythrocytes, by a buffy coat of leukocytes and platelets. Hematocrit is the
percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes. Depressed and elevated hematocrit levels are shown
for comparison.

Characteristics of Blood

When you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color. Blood that has just taken up
oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a more dusky red. This is because
hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation.

Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch. It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water.
Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the presence of the plasma proteins
and formed elements within the blood. The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and flow. Consider
the difference in flow between water and honey. The more viscous honey would demonstrate a greater resistance to flow
than the less viscous water. The same principle applies to blood.

The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature—about 38 °C (or 100.4 °F),
compared to 37 °C (or 98.6 °F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of 0.5 °C are normal.
Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth, as blood flows through them, it experiences some friction and
resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby producing heat. This accounts for its slightly higher
temperature.

The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person. Blood is therefore
somewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0. Blood contains numerous
buffers that actually help to regulate pH.

Blood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight. Adult males typically average about 5 to 6 liters of
blood. Females average 4—5 liters.

Blood Plasma

Like other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In fact, it is about 92 percent water. Dissolved
or suspended within this water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are literally hundreds of
substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only in very small quantities.

substances found in a sample of blood. Serum, one of the specimen types included, refers to a sample of plasma after
clotting factors have been removed. What types of measurements are given for levels of oxygen in the blood?

Plasma Proteins

About 7 percent of the volume of plasma—nearly all that is not water—is made of proteins. These include several plasma
proteins (proteins that are unique to the plasma), plus a much smaller number of regulatory proteins, including enzymes and

some hormones. The major components of plasma are summarized in
The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows:

Figure 18.3.

¢ Albumin is the most abundant of the plasma proteins. Manufactured by the liver, albumin molecules serve as binding
proteins—transport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid hormones. Recall that lipids are hydrophobic; however, their
binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma. Albumin is also the most significant contributor to
the osmotic pressure of blood; that is, its presence holds water inside the blood vessels and draws water from the
tissues, across blood vessel walls, and into the bloodstream. This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and
blood pressure. Albumin normally accounts for approximately 54 percent of the total plasma protein content, in clinical

levels of 3.5-5.0 g/dL blood.
¢ The second most common plasma proteins are the globulins. A

heterogeneous group, there are three main subgroups

known as alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. The alpha and beta globulins transport iron, lipids, and the fat-soluble
vitamins A, D, E, and K to the cells; like albumin, they also contribute to osmotic pressure. The gamma globulins are
proteins involved in immunity and are better known as an antibodies or immunoglobulins. Although other plasma

proteins are produced by the liver, immunoglobulins are produc

‘ed by specialized leukocytes known as plasma cells.

(Seek additional content for more information about immunoglobulins.) Globulins make up approximately 38 percent
of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels of 1.0-1.5 g/dL blood.

* The least abundant plasma protein is fibrinogen. Like albumin and the alpha and beta globulins, fibrinogen is
produced by the liver. It is essential for blood clotting, a process described later in this chapter. Fibrinogen accounts

for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinica

Other Plasma Solutes

levels of 0.2-0.45 g/dL blood.

In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances. These include various electrolytes, such as
sodium, potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; various organic
nutrients, such as vitamins, lipids, glucose, and amino acids; and metabolic wastes. All of these nonprotein solutes combined

contribute approximately 1 percent to the total volume of plasma.

Phlebotomy and Medical Lab Technology

= «

Phlebotomists are professionals trained to draw blood (phleb- = “a blood vessel”; -tomy = “to cut”). When more
than a few drops of blood are required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture, typically of a surface vein in the
arm. They perform a capillary stick on a finger, an earlobe, or the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of
blood is required. An arterial stick is collected from an artery and used to analyze blood gases. After collection, the
blood may be analyzed by medical laboratories or perhaps used for transfusions, donations, or research. While many
allied health professionals practice phlebotomy, the American Society of Phlebotomy Technicians issues certificates
to individuals passing a national examination, and some large labs and hospitals hire individuals expressively for their
skill in phlebotomy.
Medical or clinical laboratories employ a variety of individuals in technical positions:

* Medical technologists (MT), also known as clinical laboratory technologists (CLT), typically hold a bachelor’s
degree and certification from an accredited training program. They perform a wide variety of tests on various
body fluids, including blood. The information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in
determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and response to treatment.

* Medical laboratory technicians (MLT) typically have an associate’s degree but may perform duties similar to
those of an MT.

* Medical laboratory assistants (MLA) spend the majority of their time processing samples and carrying out routine
assignments within the lab. Clinical training is required, but a degree may not be essential to obtaining a position.

18.2 | Production of the Formed Elements

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Trace the generation of the formed elements of blood from bone marrow stem cells
¢ Discuss the role of hemopoietic growth factors in promoting the production of the formed elements

The lifespan of the formed elements is very brief. Although one type of leukocyte called memory cells can survive for years,
most erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets normally live only a few hours to a few weeks. Thus, the body must form new
blood cells and platelets quickly and continuously. When you donate a unit of blood during a blood drive (approximately
475 mL, or about 1 pint), your body typically replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours, but it takes about 4 to 6
weeks to replace the blood cells. This restricts the frequency with which donors can contribute their blood. The process by
which this replacement occurs is called hemopoiesis, or hematopoiesis (from the Greek root haima- = “blood”; -poiesis =
“production”).

Sites of Hemopoiesis

Prior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning with the yolk sac of the developing embryo,
and continuing in the fetal liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow. Following birth, most
hemopoiesis occurs in the red marrow, a connective tissue within the spaces of spongy (cancellous) bone tissue. In children,
hemopoiesis can occur in the medullary cavity of long bones; in adults, the process is largely restricted to the cranial and
pelvic bones, the vertebrae, the sternum, and the proximal epiphyses of the femur and humerus.

Throughout adulthood, the liver and spleen maintain their ability to generate the formed elements. This process is
referred to as extramedullary hemopoiesis (meaning hemopoiesis outside the medullary cavity of adult bones). When a
disease such as bone cancer destroys the bone marrow, causing hemopoiesis to fail, extramedullary hemopoiesis may be
initiated.

Differentiation of Formed Elements from Stem Cells

All formed elements arise from stem cells of the red bone marrow. Recall that stem cells undergo mitosis plus cytokinesis
(cellular division) to give rise to new daughter cells: One of these remains a stem cell and the other differentiates into one
of any number of diverse cell types. Stem cells may be viewed as occupying a hierarchal system, with some loss of the
ability to diversify at each step. The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized egg. The totipotent (toti- = “all”) stem
cell gives rise to all cells of the human body. The next level is the pluripotent stem cell, which gives rise to multiple types
of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes. Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell
that develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not
epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell, or
hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell.

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 743

Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called
hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem
cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more specialized stem cells
(Figure 18.4):

¢ Lymphoid stem cells give rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells,

B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes

progresses somewhat differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief, lymphoid stem cells quickly

migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their
production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells
mature in the thymus.

* Myeloid stem cells give rise to all the other formed elements, including the erythrocytes; megakaryocytes that produce
platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes: neutrophils,
eosinophils, and basophils.

After division, some cells
remain stem cells.

Figure 18.4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the
formed elements of blood.

Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements. As
you can see in Figure 18.4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of
which can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix -blast. For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors
of megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject their nucleus and most other organelles before
maturing into erythrocytes.

Hemopoietic Growth Factors

Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors. These
include the following:
¢ Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the interstitial fibroblast cells of the kidneys in response
to low oxygen levels. It prompts the production of erythrocytes. Some athletes use synthetic EPO as a performance-
enhancing drug (called blood doping) to increase RBC counts and subsequently increase oxygen delivery to tissues
throughout the body. EPO is a banned substance in most organized sports, but it is also used medically in the treatment
of certain anemia, specifically those triggered by certain types of cancer, and other disorders in which increased

¢ Thrombopoietin, another glycoprotein hormone, is produced by the liver and kidneys. It triggers the development o:
megakaryocytes into platelets.

* Cytokines are glycoproteins secreted by a wide variety of cells, including red bone marrow, leukocytes, macrophages,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. They act locally as autocrine or paracrine factors, stimulating the proliferation o
progenitor cells and helping to stimulate both nonspecific and specific resistance to disease. There are two major
subtypes of cytokines known as colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.

° Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins that act locally, as autocrine or paracrine factors. Some
trigger the differentiation of myeloblasts into granular leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils. These are referred to as granulocyte CSFs. A different CSF induces the production of monocytes,
called monocyte CSFs. Both granulocytes and monocytes are stimulated by GM-CSF; granulocytes, monocytes,
platelets, and erythrocytes are stimulated by multi-CSF. Synthetic forms of these hormones are often administered
to patients with various forms of cancer who are receiving chemotherapy to revive their WBC counts.

° Interleukins are another class of cytokine signaling molecules important in hemopoiesis. They were initially
thought to be secreted uniquely by leukocytes and to communicate only with other leukocytes, and were named
accordingly, but are now known to be produced by a variety of cells including bone marrow and endothelium.
Researchers now suspect that interleukins may play other roles in body functioning, including differentiation and
maturation of cells, producing immunity and inflammation. To date, more than a dozen interleukins have been
identified, with others likely to follow. They are generally numbered IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, etc.

Blood Doping

In its original intent, the term blood doping was used to describe the practice of injecting by transfusion supplemental
RBCs into an individual, typically to enhance performance in a sport. Additional RBCs would deliver more oxygen
to the tissues, providing extra aerobic capacity, clinically referred to as VO2 max. The source of the cells was either
from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood (homologous). This practice was aided by
the well-developed techniques of harvesting, concentrating, and freezing of the RBCs that could be later thawed and
injected, yet still retain their functionality. These practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the
risk of infection, significantly increasing the viscosity of the blood and the potential for transmission of blood-borne
pathogens if the blood was collected from another individual.

With the development of synthetic EPO in the 1980s, it became possible to provide additional RBCs by artificially
stimulating RBC production in the bone marrow. Originally developed to treat patients suffering from anemia, renal
failure, or cancer treatment, large quantities of EPO can be generated by recombinant DNA technology. Synthetic EPO
is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also induce polycythemia and raise
hematocrit to 70 or greater. This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the blood and forces the heart to pump
more powerfully; in extreme cases, it has resulted in death. Other drugs such as cobalt II chloride have been shown
to increase natural EPO gene expression. Blood doping has become problematic in many sports, especially cycling.
Lance Armstrong, winner of seven Tour de France and many other cycling titles, was stripped of his victories and

admitted to blood doping in 2013.

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 745

Bone Marrow Sampling and Transplants

Sometimes, a healthcare provider will order a bone marrow biopsy, a diagnostic test of a sample of red bone marrow, or
a bone marrow transplant, a treatment in which a donor’s healthy bone marrow—and its stem cells—replaces the faulty
bone marrow of a patient. These tests and procedures are often used to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of various severe
forms of anemia, such as thalassemia major and sickle cell anemia, as well as some types of cancer, specifically leukemia.

In the past, when a bone marrow sample or transplant was necessary, the procedure would have required inserting
a large-bore needle into the region near the iliac crest of the pelvic bones (os coxae). This location was preferred, since
its location close to the body surface makes it more accessible, and it is relatively isolated from most vital organs.
Unfortunately, the procedure is quite painful.

Now, direct sampling of bone marrow can often be avoided. In many cases, stem cells can be isolated in just a few
hours from a sample of a patient’s blood. The isolated stem cells are then grown in culture using the appropriate hemopoietic
growth factors, and analyzed or sometimes frozen for later use.

For an individual requiring a transplant, a matching donor is essential to prevent the immune system from destroying
the donor cells—a phenomenon known as tissue rejection. To treat patients with bone marrow transplants, it is first
necessary to destroy the patient’s own diseased marrow through radiation and/or chemotherapy. Donor bone marrow stem
cells are then intravenously infused. From the bloodstream, they establish themselves in the recipient’s bone marrow.

18.3 | Erythrocytes

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the anatomy of erythrocytes
* Discuss the various steps in the lifecycle of an erythrocyte
¢ Explain the composition and function of hemoglobin

The erythrocyte, commonly known as a red blood cell (or RBC), is by far the most common formed element: A single
drop of blood contains millions of erythrocytes and just thousands of leukocytes. Specifically, males have about 5.4 million
erythrocytes per microliter (uL) of blood, and females have approximately 4.8 million per pL. In fact, erythrocytes are
estimated to make up about 25 percent of the total cells in the body. As you can imagine, they are quite small cells, with
a mean diameter of only about 7-8 micrometers (um) (Figure 18.5). The primary functions of erythrocytes are to pick up
inhaled oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the body’s tissues, and to pick up some (about 24 percent) carbon dioxide
waste at the tissues and transport it to the lungs for exhalation. Erythrocytes remain within the vascular network. Although
leukocytes typically leave the blood vessels to perform their defensive functions, movement of erythrocytes from the blood
vessels is abnormal.

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 747

Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes

As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the
first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain
remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1-2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a
rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production
of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature,
circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on
anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it al
to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some
structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze
through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element.

Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6).
Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you wil.
see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur,
relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries,
the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells,
whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by
the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the passage of the erythrocytes and providing an extended
opportunity for gas exchange to occur. However, the space within capillaries can be so minute that, despite their own smal.
size, erythrocytes may have to fold in on themselves if they are to make their way through. Fortunately, their structural
proteins like spectrin are flexible, allowing them to bend over themselves to a surprising degree, then spring back again
when they enter a wider vessel. In wider vessels, erythrocytes may stack up much like a roll of coins, forming a rouleaux,
from the French word for “roll.”

Figure 18.6 Shape of Red Blood Cells Erythrocytes are biconcave discs with very shallow centers. This shape
optimizes the ratio of surface area to volume, facilitating gas exchange. It also enables them to fold up as they move
through narrow blood vessels.

Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin is a large molecule made up of proteins and iron. It consists of four folded chains of a protein called globin,
designated alpha 1 and 2, and beta 1 and 2 (Figure 18.7a). Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red pigment

molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron (Fe?*) (Figure 18.7b).

Everest and K2 in the Himalayas, many mountain climbers rely upon bottled oxygen as they near the summit.

Lifecycle of Erythrocytes

Production of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per second. For this
production to occur, a number of raw materials must be present in adequate amounts. These include the same nutrients that
are essential to the production and maintenance of any cell, such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids. However, erythrocyte
production also requires several trace elements:

* Iron. We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron. On
average, less than 20 percent of the iron we consume is absorbed. Heme iron, from animal foods such as meat, poultry,
and fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods. Upon absorption, iron becomes part of
the body’s total iron pool. The bone marrow, liver, and spleen can store iron in the protein compounds ferritin and
hemosiderin. Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites
into tissue fluid where it enters the blood. When EPO stimulates the production of erythrocytes, iron is released from
storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors.

* Copper. A trace mineral, copper is a component of two plasma proteins, hephaestin and ceruloplasmin. Without these,
hemoglobin could not be adequately produced. Located in intestinal villi, hephaestin enables iron to be absorbed by

intestinal cells. Ceruloplasmin transports copper. Both enable the oxidation of iron from Fe* to Fe**, a form in which

it can be bound to its transport protein, transferrin, for transport to body cells. In a state of copper deficiency, the

transport of iron for heme synthesis decreases, and iron can accumulate in tissues, where it can eventually lead to organ
damage.

* Zinc. The trace mineral zinc functions as a co-enzyme that facilitates the synthesis of the heme portion of hemoglobin.

* B vitamins. The B vitamins folate and vitamin B12 function as co-enzymes that facilitate DNA synthesis. Thus, both
are critical for the synthesis of new cells, including erythrocytes.
Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid

phagocytic cell called a macrophage, located primarily within the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The components of the
degraded erythrocytes’ hemoglobin are further processed as follows:

* Globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin, is broken down into amino acids, which can be sent back to the bone
marrow to be used in the production of new erythrocytes. Hemoglobin that is not phagocytized is broken down in the
circulation, releasing alpha and beta chains that are removed from circulation by the kidneys.

¢ The iron contained in the heme portion of hemoglobin may be stored in the liver or spleen, primarily in the form of
ferritin or hemosiderin, or carried through the bloodstream by transferrin to the red bone marrow for recycling into
new erythrocytes.

¢ The non-iron portion of heme is degraded into the waste product biliverdin, a green pigment, and then into another
waste product, bilirubin, a yellow pigment. Bilirubin binds to albumin and travels in the blood to the liver, which
uses it in the manufacture of bile, a compound released into the intestines to help emulsify dietary fats. In the large
intestine, bacteria breaks the bilirubin apart from the bile and converts it to urobilinogen and then into stercobilin. It is
then eliminated from the body in the feces. Broad-spectrum antibiotics typically eliminate these bacteria as well and
may alter the color of feces. The kidneys also remove any circulating bilirubin and other related metabolic byproducts
such as urobilins and secrete them into the urine.

The breakdown pigments formed from the destruction of hemoglobin can be seen in a variety of situations. At the site
of an injury, biliverdin from damaged RBCs produces some of the dramatic colors associated with bruising. With a failing
liver, bilirubin cannot be removed effectively from circulation and causes the body to assume a yellowish tinge associated
with jaundice. Stercobilins within the feces produce the typical brown color associated with this waste. And the yellow of
urine is associated with the urobilins.

The erythrocyte lifecycle is summarized in Figure 18.8.

Disorders of Erythrocytes

The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major impact on a
person’s health. When the number of RBCs or hemoglobin is deficient, the general condition is called anemia. There are
more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. Anemia can be broken
down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and
those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach
focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the morphological approach examines the

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 751

RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size. A common test is the mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which
measures size. Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic, smaller-than-normal cells are referred to as microcytic, and
larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic. Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate
production of RBCs. The effects of the various anemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin
will result in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues. Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning, anemia
produces fatigue, lethargy, and an increased risk for infection. An oxygen deficit in the brain impairs the ability to think
clearly, and may prompt headaches and irritability. Lack of oxygen leaves the patient short of breath, even as the heart and
lungs work harder in response to the deficit.

Blood loss anemias are fairly straightforward. In addition to bleeding from wounds or other lesions, these forms o
anemia may be due to ulcers, hemorrhoids, inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), and some cancers of the gastrointestinal
tract. The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can trigger ulceration
and gastritis. Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential causes.

Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin
deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells.

* A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cel
anemia). A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S,
which delivers less oxygen to tissues and causes erythrocytes to assume a sickle (or crescent) shape, especially at low
oxygen concentrations (Figure 18.9). These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries
because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood flow to tissues and causing a
variety of serious problems from painful joints to delayed growth and even blindness and cerebrovascular accidents
(strokes). Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent.

Figure 18.9 Sickle Cells Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in one of the hemoglobin genes. Erythrocytes
produce an abnormal type of hemoglobin, which causes the cell to take on a sickle or crescent shape. (credit: Janice
Haney Carr)

¢ Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type and results when the amount of available iron is insufficient to allow
production of sufficient heme. This condition can occur in individuals with a deficiency of iron in the diet and is
especially common in teens and children as well as in vegans and vegetarians. Additionally, iron deficiency anemia
may be caused by either an inability to absorb and transport iron or slow, chronic bleeding.

* Vitamin-deficient anemias generally involve insufficient vitamin B12 and folate.

° Megaloblastic anemia involves a deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate, and often involves diets deficient in
these essential nutrients. Lack of meat or a viable alternate source, and overcooking or eating insufficient amounts
of vegetables may lead to a lack of folate.

° Pernicious anemia is caused by poor absorption of vitamin B12 and is often seen in patients with Crohn’s disease
(a severe intestinal disorder often treated by surgery), surgical removal of the intestines or stomach (common in
some weight loss surgeries), intestinal parasites, and AIDS.

° Pregnancies, some medications, excessive alcohol consumption, and some diseases such as celiac disease are
also associated with vitamin deficiencies. It is essential to provide sufficient folic acid during the early stages of
pregnancy to reduce the risk of neurological defects, including spina bifida, a failure of the neural tube to close.

752 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

* Assorted disease processes can also interfere with the production and formation of RBCs and hemoglobin. If myeloid
stem cells are defective or replaced by cancer cells, there will be insufficient quantities of RBCs produced.

° Aplastic anemia is the condition in which there are deficient numbers of RBC stem cells. Aplastic anemia is often
inherited, or it may be triggered by radiation, medication, chemotherapy, or infection.

e Thalassemia is an inherited condition typically occurring in individuals from the Middle East, the
Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asia, in which maturation of the RBCs does not proceed normally. The
most severe form is called Cooley’s anemia.

° Lead exposure from industrial sources or even dust from paint chips of iron-containing paints or pottery that has
not been properly glazed may also lead to destruction of the red marrow.

* Various disease processes also can lead to anemias. These include chronic kidney diseases often associated with a
decreased production of EPO, hypothyroidism, some forms of cancer, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.
In contrast to anemia, an elevated RBC count is called polycythemia and is detected in a patient’s elevated hematocrit.
It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water losses are excessive,
the plasma volume falls. As a result, the hematocrit rises. For reasons mentioned earlier, a mild form of polycythemia is
chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes. Some elite athletes train at high elevations specifically to induce this
phenomenon. Finally, a type of bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera (from the Greek vera = “true”) causes an
excessive production of immature erythrocytes. Polycythemia vera can dangerously elevate the viscosity of blood, raising
blood pressure and making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. It is a relatively rare disease
that occurs more often in men than women, and is more likely to be present in elderly patients those over 60 years of age.

18.4 | Leukocytes and Platelets

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the general characteristics of leukocytes
* Classify leukocytes according to their lineage, their main structural features, and their primary functions
¢ Discuss the most common malignancies involving leukocytes

¢ Identify the lineage, basic structure, and function of platelets

The leukocyte, commonly known as a white blood cell (or WBC), is a major component of the body’s defenses against
disease. Leukocytes protect the body against invading microorganisms and body cells with mutated DNA, and they clean up
debris. Platelets are essential for the repair of blood vessels when damage to them has occurred; they also provide growth
factors for healing and repair. See Figure 18.5 for a summary of leukocytes and platelets.

Characteristics of Leukocytes

Although leukocytes and erythrocytes both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, they are very
different from each other in many significant ways. For instance, leukocytes are far less numerous than erythrocytes:
Typically there are only 5000 to 10,000 per wL. They are also larger than erythrocytes and are the only formed elements that
are complete cells, possessing a nucleus and organelles. And although there is just one type of erythrocyte, there are many
types of leukocytes. Most of these types have a much shorter lifespan than that of erythrocytes, some as short as a few hours
or even a few minutes in the case of acute infection.

One of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement. Whereas erythrocytes spend their days
circulating within the blood vessels, leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions in
the body’s tissues. For leukocytes, the vascular network is simply a highway they travel and soon exit to reach their true
destination. When they arrive, they are often given distinct names, such as macrophage or microglia, depending on their
function. As shown in Figure 18.10, they leave the capillaries—the smallest blood vessels—or other small vessels through
a process known as emigration (from the Latin for “removal”) or diapedesis (dia- = “through”; -pedan = “to leap”) in
which they squeeze through adjacent cells in a blood vessel wall.

Once they have exited the capillaries, some leukocytes will take up fixed positions in lymphatic tissue, bone marrow,
the spleen, the thymus, or other organs. Others will move about through the tissue spaces very much like amoebas,
continuously extending their plasma membranes, sometimes wandering freely, and sometimes moving toward the direction
in which they are drawn by chemical signals. This attracting of leukocytes occurs because of positive chemotaxis (literally
“movement in response to chemicals”), a phenomenon in which injured or infected cells and nearby leukocytes emit the
equivalent of a chemical “911” call, attracting more leukocytes to the site. In clinical medicine, the differential counts of the
types and percentages of leukocytes present are often key indicators in making a diagnosis and selecting a treatment.

Figure 18.10 Emigration Leukocytes exit the blood vessel and then move through the connective tissue of the dermis

leukocytes. They release chemicals from their granules that destroy pathogens; they are also capable of phagocytosis.
The monocyte, an agranular leukocyte, differentiates into a macrophage that then phagocytizes the pathogens.

Classification of Leukocytes

When scientists first began to observe stained blood slides, it quickly became evident that leukocytes could be divided into
two groups, according to whether their cytoplasm contained highly visible granules:

¢ Granular leukocytes contain abundant granules within the cytoplasm. They include neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils (you can view their lineage from myeloid stem cells in Figure 18.4).

754 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

¢ While granules are not totally lacking in agranular leukocytes, they are far fewer and less obvious. Agranular
leukocytes include monocytes, which mature into macrophages that are phagocytic, and lymphocytes, which arise
from the lymphoid stem cell line.

Granular Leukocytes

We will consider the granular leukocytes in order from most common to least common. All of these are produced in the red
bone marrow and have a short lifespan of hours to days. They typically have a lobed nucleus and are classified according to
which type of stain best highlights their granules (Figure 18.11).

Neutrophil Eosinophil Basophil

Figure 18.11 Granular Leukocytes A neutrophil has small granules that stain light lilac and a nucleus with two to
five lobes. An eosinophil’s granules are slightly larger and stain reddish-orange, and its nucleus has two to three lobes.
A basophil has large granules that stain dark blue to purple and a two-lobed nucleus.

The most common of all the leukocytes, neutrophils will normally comprise 50-70 percent of total leukocyte count.
They are 10-12 jm in diameter, significantly larger than erythrocytes. They are called neutrophils because their granules
show up most clearly with stains that are chemically neutral (neither acidic nor basic). The granules are numerous but
quite fine and normally appear light lilac. The nucleus has a distinct lobed appearance and may have two to five lobes, the
number increasing with the age of the cell. Older neutrophils have increasing numbers of lobes and are often referred to as
polymorphonuclear (a nucleus with many forms), or simply “polys.” Younger and immature neutrophils begin to develop
lobes and are known as “bands.”

Neutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria.
Their granules include lysozyme, an enzyme capable of lysing, or breaking down, bacterial cell walls; oxidants such as
hydrogen peroxide; and defensins, proteins that bind to and puncture bacterial and fungal plasma membranes, so that
the cell contents leak out. Abnormally high counts of neutrophils indicate infection and/or inflammation, particularly
triggered by bacteria, but are also found in burn patients and others experiencing unusual stress. A burn injury increases the
proliferation of neutrophils in order to fight off infection that can result from the destruction of the barrier of the skin. Low
counts may be caused by drug toxicity and other disorders, and may increase an individual’s susceptibility to infection.

Eosinophils typically represent 2-4 percent of total leukocyte count. They are also 10-12 ym in diameter. The granules
of eosinophils stain best with an acidic stain known as eosin. The nucleus of the eosinophil will typically have two to three
lobes and, if stained properly, the granules will have a distinct red to orange color.

The granules of eosinophils include antihistamine molecules, which counteract the activities of histamines,
inflammatory chemicals produced by basophils and mast cells. Some eosinophil granules contain molecules toxic to
parasitic worms, which can enter the body through the integument, or when an individual consumes raw or undercooked
‘ish or meat. Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosis and are particularly effective when antibodies bind to the target
and form an antigen-antibody complex. High counts of eosinophils are typical of patients experiencing allergies, parasitic
worm infestations, and some autoimmune diseases. Low counts may be due to drug toxicity and stress.

Basophils are the least common leukocytes, typically comprising less than one percent of the total leukocyte count.
[hey are slightly smaller than neutrophils and eosinophils at 8-10 pm in diameter. The granules of basophils stain best with
basic (alkaline) stains. Basophils contain large granules that pick up a dark blue stain and are so common they may make it
difficult to see the two-lobed nucleus.

In general, basophils intensify the inflammatory response. They share this trait with mast cells. In the past, mast cells
were considered to be basophils that left the circulation. However, this appears not to be the case, as the two cell types
develop from different lineages.

The granules of basophils release histamines, which contribute to inflammation, and heparin, which opposes blood
clotting. High counts of basophils are associated with allergies, parasitic infections, and hypothyroidism. Low counts are
associated with pregnancy, stress, and hyperthyroidism.

Agranular Leukocytes

Agranular leukocytes contain smaller, less-visible granules in their cytoplasm than do granular leukocytes. The nucleus is
simple in shape, sometimes with an indentation but without distinct lobes. There are two major types of agranulocytes:
lymphocytes and monocytes (see Figure 18.4).

Lymphocytes are the only formed element of blood that arises from lymphoid stem cells. Although they form initially
in the bone marrow, much of their subsequent development and reproduction occurs in the lymphatic tissues. Lymphocytes
are the second most common type of leukocyte, accounting for about 20-30 percent of all leukocytes, and are essential for

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 755

the immune response. The size range of lymphocytes is quite extensive, with some authorities recognizing two size classes
and others three. Typically, the large cells are 10-14 ym and have a smaller nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and more granules.
The smaller cells are typically 6-9 ym with a larger volume of nucleus to cytoplasm, creating a “halo” effect. A few cells
may fall outside these ranges, at 14-17 jm. This finding has led to the three size range classification.

The three major groups of lymphocytes include natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells
are capable of recognizing cells that do not express “self” proteins on their plasma membrane or that contain foreign or
abnormal markers. These “nonself” cells include cancer cells, cells infected with a virus, and other cells with atypical
surface proteins. Thus, they provide generalized, nonspecific immunity. The larger lymphocytes are typically NK cells.

B cells and T cells, also called B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, play prominent roles in defending the body
against specific pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and are involved in specific immunity. One form of B cells
(plasma cells) produces the antibodies or immunoglobulins that bind to specific foreign or abnormal components of plasma
membranes. This is also referred to as humoral (body fluid) immunity. T cells provide cellular-level immunity by physically
attacking foreign or diseased cells. A memory cell is a variety of both B and T cells that forms after exposure to a pathogen
and mounts rapid responses upon subsequent exposures. Unlike other leukocytes, memory cells live for many years. B
cells undergo a maturation process in the bone marrow, whereas T cells undergo maturation in the thymus. This site of the
maturation process gives rise to the name B and T cells. The functions of lymphocytes are complex and will be covered in
detail in the chapter covering the lymphatic system and immunity. Smaller lymphocytes are either B or T cells, although
they cannot be differentiated in a normal blood smear.

Abnormally high lymphocyte counts are characteristic of viral infections as well as some types of cancer. Abnormally
low lymphocyte counts are characteristic of prolonged (chronic) illness or immunosuppression, including that caused by
HIV infection and drug therapies that often involve steroids.

Monocytes originate from myeloid stem cells. They normally represent 2-8 percent of the total leukocyte count. They
are typically easily recognized by their large size of 12-20 ym and indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. Macrophages are
monocytes that have left the circulation and phagocytize debris, foreign pathogens, worn-out erythrocytes, and many other
dead, worn out, or damaged cells. Macrophages also release antimicrobial defensins and chemotactic chemicals that attract
other leukocytes to the site of an infection. Some macrophages occupy fixed locations, whereas others wander through the
tissue fluid.

Abnormally high counts of monocytes are associated with viral or fungal infections, tuberculosis, and some forms of
leukemia and other chronic diseases. Abnormally low counts are typically caused by suppression of the bone marrow.

Lifecycle of Leukocytes

Most leukocytes have a relatively short lifespan, typically measured in hours or days. Production of all leukocytes begins
in the bone marrow under the influence of CSFs and interleukins. Secondary production and maturation of lymphocytes
occurs in specific regions of lymphatic tissue known as germinal centers. Lymphocytes are fully capable of mitosis and may
produce clones of cells with identical properties. This capacity enables an individual to maintain immunity throughout life
to many threats that have been encountered in the past.

Disorders of Leukocytes

Leukopenia is a condition in which too few leukocytes are produced. If this condition is pronounced, the individual may
be unable to ward off disease. Excessive leukocyte proliferation is known as leukocytosis. Although leukocyte counts are
high, the cells themselves are often nonfunctional, leaving the individual at increased risk for disease.

Leukemia is a cancer involving an abundance of leukocytes. It may involve only one specific type of leukocyte from
either the myeloid line (myelocytic leukemia) or the lymphoid line (lymphocytic leukemia). In chronic leukemia, mature
leukocytes accumulate and fail to die. In acute leukemia, there is an overproduction of young, immature leukocytes. In both
conditions the cells do not function properly.

Lymphoma is a form of cancer in which masses of malignant T and/or B lymphocytes collect in lymph nodes, the
spleen, the liver, and other tissues. As in leukemia, the malignant leukocytes do not function properly, and the patient is
vulnerable to infection. Some forms of lymphoma tend to progress slowly and respond well to treatment. Others tend to
progress quickly and require aggressive treatment, without which they are rapidly fatal.

Platelets

You may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes, but because this name suggests they are a type of cell,
it is not accurate. A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte that is
surrounded by a plasma membrane. Megakaryocytes are descended from myeloid stem cells (see Figure 18.4) and are large,
typically 50-100 ym in diameter, and contain an enlarged, lobed nucleus. As noted earlier, thrombopoietin, a glycoprotein
secreted by the kidneys and liver, stimulates the proliferation of megakaryoblasts, which mature into megakaryocytes. These
remain within bone marrow tissue (Figure 18.12) and ultimately form platelet-precursor extensions that extend through the
walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the circulation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments, each enclosed by a bit
of plasma membrane. These enclosed fragments are platelets. Each megakarocyte releases 2000-3000 platelets during its
lifespan. Following platelet release, megakaryocyte remnants, which are little more than a cell nucleus, are consumed by
macrophages.

756 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

Platelets are relatively small, 2-4 jm in diameter, but numerous, with typically 150,000-160,000 per pL of blood.
After entering the circulation, approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response to
any rupture in a blood vessel. They then become activated to perform their primary function, which is to limit blood loss.

Platelets remain only about 10 days, then are phagocytized by macrophages.

Platelets are critical to hemostasis, the stoppage of blood flow following damage to a vessel. They also secrete a variety
of growth factors essential for growth and repair of tissue, particularly connective tissue. Infusions of concentrated platelets

are now being used in some therapies to stimulate healing.

may not clot properly, and excessive bleeding may result.

the numbers represent a normal blood smear or does something appear to be abnormal?

18.5 | Hemostasis

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the three mechanisms involved in hemostasis

¢ Explain how the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways lead to the common pathway, and the coagulation
factors involved in each

* Discuss disorders affecting hemostasis

Platelets are key players in hemostasis, the process by which the body seals a ruptured blood vessel and prevents further
loss of blood. Although rupture of larger vessels usually requires medical intervention, hemostasis is quite effective in
dealing with small, simple wounds. There are three steps to the process: vascular spasm, the formation of a platelet plug,
and coagulation (blood clotting). Failure of any of these steps will result in hemorrhage—excessive bleeding.

Vascular Spasm

When a vessel is severed or punctured, or when the wall of a vessel is damaged, vascular spasm occurs. In vascular spasm,
the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel contracts dramatically. This smooth muscle has both circular layers; larger
vessels also have longitudinal layers. The circular layers tend to constrict the flow of blood, whereas the longitudinal layers,
when present, draw the vessel back into the surrounding tissue, often making it more difficult for a surgeon to locate, clamp,
and tie off a severed vessel. The vascular spasm response is believed to be triggered by several chemicals called endothelins
that are released by vessel-lining cells and by pain receptors in response to vessel injury. This phenomenon typically lasts
for up to 30 minutes, although it can last for hours.

Formation of the Platelet Plug

In the second step, platelets, which normally float free in the plasma, encounter the area of vessel rupture with the exposed
underlying connective tissue and collagenous fibers. The platelets begin to clump together, become spiked and sticky, and
bind to the exposed collagen and endothelial lining. This process is assisted by a glycoprotein in the blood plasma called

758 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

von Willebrand factor, which helps stabilize the growing platelet plug. As platelets collect, they simultaneously release
chemicals from their granules into the plasma that further contribute to hemostasis. Among the substances released by the
platelets are:
* adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which helps additional platelets to adhere to the injury site, reinforcing and expanding
the platelet plug
¢ serotonin, which maintains vasoconstriction
* prostaglandins and phospholipids, which also maintain vasoconstriction and help to activate further clotting chemicals,
as discussed next
A platelet plug can temporarily seal a small opening in a blood vessel. Plug formation, in essence, buys the body time
while more sophisticated and durable repairs are being made. In a similar manner, even modern naval warships still carry
an assortment of wooden plugs to temporarily repair small breaches in their hulls until permanent repairs can be made.

Coagulation

Those more sophisticated and more durable repairs are collectively called coagulation, the formation of a blood clot. The
process is sometimes characterized as a cascade, because one event prompts the next as in a multi-level waterfall. The result
is the production of a gelatinous but robust clot made up of a mesh of fibrin—an insoluble filamentous protein derived from
fibrinogen, the plasma protein introduced earlier—in which platelets and blood cells are trapped. Figure 18.14 summarizes
the three steps of hemostasis.

Clotting Factors Involved in Coagulation

In the coagulation cascade, chemicals called clotting factors (or coagulation factors) prompt reactions that activate still
more coagulation factors. The process is complex, but is initiated along two basic pathways:
¢ The extrinsic pathway, which normally is triggered by trauma.
¢ The intrinsic pathway, which begins in the bloodstream and is triggered by internal damage to the wall of the vessel.
Both of these merge into a third pathway, referred to as the common pathway (see Figure 18.14b). All three pathways
are dependent upon the 12 known clotting factors, including Ca** and vitamin K (Table 18.1). Clotting factors are secreted

primarily by the liver and the platelets. The liver requires the fat-soluble vitamin K to produce many of them. Vitamin K
(along with biotin and folate) is somewhat unusual among vitamins in that it is not only consumed in the diet but is also

760 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

synthesized by bacteria residing in the large intestine. The calcium ion, considered factor IV, is derived from the diet and
from the breakdown of bone. Some recent evidence indicates that activation of various clotting factors occurs on specific
receptor sites on the surfaces of platelets.

The 12 clotting factors are numbered | through XIII according to the order of their discovery. Factor VI was once
believed to be a distinct clotting factor, but is now thought to be identical to factor V. Rather than renumber the other factors,
factor VI was allowed to remain as a placeholder and also a reminder that knowledge changes over time.

Extrinsic Pathway

The quicker responding and more direct extrinsic pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) begins when
damage occurs to the surrounding tissues, such as in a traumatic injury. Upon contact with blood plasma, the damaged

extravascular cells, which are extrinsic to the bloodstream, release factor III (thromboplastin). Sequentially, Ca** then factor
VII (proconvertin), which is activated by factor III, are added, forming an enzyme complex. This enzyme complex leads
to activation of factor X (Stuart—Prower factor), which activates the common pathway discussed below. The events in the
extrinsic pathway are completed in a matter of seconds.

Intrinsic Pathway

The intrinsic pathway (also known as the contact activation pathway) is longer and more complex. In this case, the factors
involved are intrinsic to (present within) the bloodstream. The pathway can be prompted by damage to the tissues, resulting
from internal factors such as arterial disease; however, it is most often initiated when factor XII (Hageman factor) comes
into contact with foreign materials, such as when a blood sample is put into a glass test tube. Within the body, factor
XII is typically activated when it encounters negatively charged molecules, such as inorganic polymers and phosphate

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 761

produced earlier in the series of intrinsic pathway reactions. Factor XII sets off a series of reactions that in turn activates
factor XI (antihemolytic factor C or plasma thromboplastin antecedent) then factor IX (antihemolytic factor B or plasma
thromboplasmin). In the meantime, chemicals released by the platelets increase the rate of these activation reactions. Finally,
factor VIII (antihemolytic factor A) from the platelets and endothelial cells combines with factor IX (antihemolytic factor
B or plasma thromboplasmin) to form an enzyme complex that activates factor X (Stuart—Prower factor or thrombokinase),
leading to the common pathway. The events in the intrinsic pathway are completed in a few minutes.

Common Pathway

Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways lead to the common pathway, in which fibrin is produced to seal off the vessel.
Once factor X has been activated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway, the enzyme prothrombinase converts factor II,
the inactive enzyme prothrombin, into the active enzyme thrombin. (Note that if the enzyme thrombin were not normally
in an inactive form, clots would form spontaneously, a condition not consistent with life.) Then, thrombin converts factor I,
the insoluble fibrinogen, into the soluble fibrin protein strands. Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot.

Fibrinolysis

The stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets. As these proteins contract, they pull on the
fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose shoelaces
(see Figure 18.14a). This process also wrings out of the clot a small amount of fluid called serum, which is blood plasma
without its clotting factors.

To restore normal blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed. Fibrinolysis is the gradual
degradation of the clot. Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and protein-
catabolizing enzymes. During this process, the inactive protein plasminogen is converted into the active plasmin, which
gradually breaks down the fibrin of the clot. Additionally, bradykinin, a vasodilator, is released, reversing the effects of the
serotonin and prostaglandins from the platelets. This allows the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessels to relax and helps
to restore the circulation.

Plasma Anticoagulants

An anticoagulant is any substance that opposes coagulation. Several circulating plasma anticoagulants play a role in
limiting the coagulation process to the region of injury and restoring a normal, clot-free condition of blood. For instance,
a cluster of proteins collectively referred to as the protein C system inactivates clotting factors involved in the intrinsic
pathway. TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) inhibits the conversion of the inactive factor VII to the active form in the
extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin inactivates factor X and opposes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin
in the common pathway. And as noted earlier, basophils release heparin, a short-acting anticoagulant that also opposes
prothrombin. Heparin is also found on the surfaces of cells lining the blood vessels. A pharmaceutical form of heparin is
often administered therapeutically, for example, in surgical patients at risk for blood clots.

View these animations (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/coagulation) to explore the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common
pathways that are involved the process of coagulation. The coagulation cascade restores hemostasis by activating
coagulation factors in the presence of an injury. How does the endothelium of the blood vessel walls prevent the blood
from coagulating as it flows through the blood vessels?

Disorders of Clotting

Either an insufficient or an excessive production of platelets can lead to severe disease or death. As discussed earlier, an
insufficient number of platelets, called thrombocytopenia, typically results in the inability of blood to form clots. This can
lead to excessive bleeding, even from minor wounds.

Another reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more
clotting factors. This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia, which is actually a group of related disorders, the

762 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

most common of which is hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. This disorder results in the
inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII. Hemophilia B is the second most common form, accounting
for approximately 20 percent of cases. In this case, there is a deficiency of factor IX. Both of these defects are linked to
the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy (carrier) mother to her male offspring, since males are XY.
Females would need to inherit a defective gene from each parent to manifest the disease, since they are XX. Patients with
hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds, and leak blood into joint spaces after exercise and into
urine and stool. Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal (not sex) chromosome that renders
factor XI nonfunctional. It is not a true recessive condition, since even individuals with a single copy of the mutant gene
show a tendency to bleed. Regular infusions of clotting factors isolated from healthy donors can help prevent bleeding in
hemophiliac patients. At some point, genetic therapy will become a viable option.

In contrast to the disorders characterized by coagulation failure is thrombocytosis, also mentioned earlier, a condition
characterized by excessive numbers of platelets that increases the risk for excessive clot formation, a condition known as
thrombosis. A thrombus (plural = thrombi) is an aggregation of platelets, erythrocytes, and even WBCs typically trapped
within a mass of fibrin strands. While the formation of a clot is normal following the hemostatic mechanism just described,
thrombi can form within an intact or only slightly damaged blood vessel. In a large vessel, a thrombus will adhere to the
vessel wall and decrease the flow of blood, and is referred to as a mural thrombus. In a small vessel, it may actually totally
block the flow of blood and is termed an occlusive thrombus. Thrombi are most commonly caused by vessel damage to
the endothelial lining, which activates the clotting mechanism. These may include venous stasis, when blood in the veins,
particularly in the legs, remains stationary for long periods. This is one of the dangers of long airplane flights in crowded
conditions and may lead to deep vein thrombosis or atherosclerosis, an accumulation of debris in arteries. Thrombophilia,
also called hypercoagulation, is a condition in which there is a tendency to form thrombosis. This may be familial (genetic)
or acquired. Acquired forms include the autoimmune disease lupus, immune reactions to heparin, polycythemia vera,
thrombocytosis, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, and even obesity. A thrombus can seriously impede blood flow to or from a
region and will cause a local increase in blood pressure. If flow is to be maintained, the heart will need to generate a greater
pressure to overcome the resistance.

When a portion of a thrombus breaks free from the vessel wall and enters the circulation, it is referred to as an embolus.
An embolus that is carried through the bloodstream can be large enough to block a vessel critical to a major organ. When
it becomes trapped, an embolus is called an embolism. In the heart, brain, or lungs, an embolism may accordingly cause a
heart attack, a stroke, or a pulmonary embolism. These are medical emergencies.

Among the many known biochemical activities of aspirin is its role as an anticoagulant. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is
very effective at inhibiting the aggregation of platelets. It is routinely administered during a heart attack or stroke to reduce
the adverse effects. Physicians sometimes recommend that patients at risk for cardiovascular disease take a low dose of
aspirin on a daily basis as a preventive measure. However, aspirin can also lead to serious side effects, including increasing
the risk of ulcers. A patient is well advised to consult a physician before beginning any aspirin regimen.

A class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal
clot. If a thrombolytic agent is administered to a patient within 3 hours following a thrombotic stroke, the patient’s
prognosis improves significantly. However, some strokes are not caused by thrombi, but by hemorrhage. Thus, the cause
must be determined before treatment begins. Tissue plasminogen activator is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
plasminogen to plasmin, the primary enzyme that breaks down clots. It is released naturally by endothelial cells but is also
used in clinical medicine. New research is progressing using compounds isolated from the venom of some species of snakes,
particularly vipers and cobras, which may eventually have therapeutic value as thrombolytic agents.

18.6 | Blood Typing

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the two basic physiological consequences of transfusion of incompatible blood
¢ Compare and contrast ABO and Rh blood groups
¢ Identify which blood groups may be safely transfused into patients with different ABO types
* Discuss the pathophysiology of hemolytic disease of the newborn

Blood transfusions in humans were risky procedures until the discovery of the major human blood groups by Karl
Landsteiner, an Austrian biologist and physician, in 1900. Until that point, physicians did not understand that death
sometimes followed blood transfusions, when the type of donor blood infused into the patient was incompatible with the
patient’s own blood. Blood groups are determined by the presence or absence of specific marker molecules on the plasma
membranes of erythrocytes. With their discovery, it became possible for the first time to match patient-donor blood types
and prevent transfusion reactions and deaths.

Antigens, Antibodies, and Transfusion Reactions

Antigens are substances that the body does not recognize as belonging to the “self” and that therefore trigger a defensive

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 763

we will focus on the role of immunity in blood transfusion reactions. With RBCs in particular, you may see the antigens
referred to as isoantigens or agglutinogens (surface antigens) and the antibodies referred to as isoantibodies or agglutinins.
In this chapter, we will use the more common terms antigens and antibodies.

Antigens are generally large proteins, but may include other classes of organic molecules, including carbohydrates,
lipids, and nucleic acids. Following an infusion of incompatible blood, erythrocytes with foreign antigens appear in the
bloodstream and trigger an immune response. Proteins called antibodies (immunoglobulins), which are produced by certain
B lymphocytes called plasma cells, attach to the antigens on the plasma membranes of the infused erythrocytes and cause
them to adhere to one another.

* Because the arms of the Y-shaped antibodies attach randomly to more than one nonself erythrocyte surface, they form
clumps of erythrocytes. This process is called agglutination.
¢ The clumps of erythrocytes block small blood vessels throughout the body, depriving tissues of oxygen and nutrients.
¢ As the erythrocyte clumps are degraded, in a process called hemolysis, their hemoglobin is released into the
bloodstream. This hemoglobin travels to the kidneys, which are responsible for filtration of the blood. However, the
load of hemoglobin released can easily overwhelm the kidney’s capacity to clear it, and the patient can quickly develop
kidney failure.

More than 50 antigens have been identified on erythrocyte membranes, but the most significant in terms of their

potential harm to patients are classified in two groups: the ABO blood group and the Rh blood group.

The ABO Blood Group

Although the ABO blood group name consists of three letters, ABO blood typing designates the presence or absence of just
two antigens, A and B. Both are glycoproteins. People whose erythrocytes have A antigens on their erythrocyte membrane
surfaces are designated blood type A, and those whose erythrocytes have B antigens are blood type B. People can also have
both A and B antigens on their erythrocytes, in which case they are blood type AB. People with neither A nor B antigens
are designated blood type O. ABO blood types are genetically determined.

Normally the body must be exposed to a foreign antigen before an antibody can be produced. This is not the case for
the ABO blood group. Individuals with type A blood—without any prior exposure to incompatible blood—have preformed
antibodies to the B antigen circulating in their blood plasma. These antibodies, referred to as anti-B antibodies, will cause
agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter erythrocytes with B antigens. Similarly, an individual with type B
blood has pre-formed anti-A antibodies. Individuals with type AB blood, which has both antigens, do not have preformed
antibodies to either of these. People with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes, but both anti-A and
anti-B antibodies circulate in their blood plasma.

Rh Blood Groups

The Rh blood group is classified according to the presence or absence of a second erythrocyte antigen identified as Rh.
(It was first discovered in a type of primate known as a rhesus macaque, which is often used in research, because its blood
is similar to that of humans.) Although dozens of Rh antigens have been identified, only one, designated D, is clinically
important. Those who have the Rh D antigen present on their erythrocytes—about 85 percent of Americans—are described

as Rh positive (Rh*) and those who lack it are Rh negative (Rh’). Note that the Rh group is distinct from the ABO group,
so any individual, no matter their ABO blood type, may have or lack this Rh antigen. When identifying a patient’s blood
type, the Rh group is designated by adding the word positive or negative to the ABO type. For example, A positive (A*)
means ABO group A blood with the Rh antigen present, and AB negative (AB ) means ABO group AB blood without the

Rh antigen.
Table 18.2 summarizes the distribution of the ABO and Rh blood types within the United States.

In contrast to the ABO group antibodies, which are preformed, antibodies to the

Rh’ individuals after exposure to the antigen. This process, called sensitization, occurs

Rh antigen are produced only in

ollowing a transfusion with Rh-

incompatible blood or, more commonly, with the birth of an Rh* baby to an Rh mother. Problems are rare in a first

pregnancy, since the baby’s Rh” cells rarely cross the placenta (the organ of gas and nutrient exchange between the baby

and the mother). However, during or immediately after birth, the Rh mother can be
(Figure 18.15). Research has shown that this occurs in about 13-14 percent of such

exposed to the baby’s Rh” cells
pregnancies. After exposure, the

mother’s immune system begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies. If the mother should then conceive another Rh” baby, the
Rh antibodies she has produced can cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream and destroy the fetal RBCs. This condition,
known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the

agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in t

antibody

Figure 18.15 Erythroblastosis Fetalis The first exposure of an Rh” mother to Rh* erythrocytes during pregnancy
induces sensitization. Anti-Rh antibodies begin to circulate in the mother’s bloodstream. A second exposure occurs

with a subsequent pregnancy with an Rh* fetus in the uterus. Maternal anti-Rh antibodies may cross the placenta and
enter the fetal bloodstream, causing agglutination and hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes.

A drug known as RhoGAM, short for Rh immune globulin, can temporarily prevent the development of Rh antibodies
in the Rh mother, thereby averting this potentially serious disease for the fetus. RhoGAM antibodies destroy any fetal Rh*
erythrocytes that may cross the placental barrier. RhoGAM is normally administered to Rh_ mothers during weeks 26-28
of pregnancy and within 72 hours following birth. It has proven remarkably effective in decreasing the incidence of HDN.

Earlier we noted that the incidence of HDN in an Rh* subsequent pregnancy to an Rh_ mother is about 13-14 percent
without preventive treatment. Since the introduction of RhoGAM in 1968, the incidence has dropped to about 0.1 percent
in the United States.

ABO Cross Matching

Clinicians are able to determine a patient’s blood type quickly and easily using commercially prepared antibodies. In this
laboratory test, called cross matching, a sample of blood of unknown type is placed into separate wells. Into one well a
small amount of anti-A antibody is added, and to another a small amount of anti-B antibody. If the antigen is present, the
antibodies will cause visible agglutination of the cells (Figure 18.16). The blood should also be tested for Rh antibodies.

Figure 18.16 Cross Matching Blood Types This sample of a commercially produced “bedside” card enables quick
typing of both a recipient’s and donor’s blood before transfusion. The card contains three reaction sites or wells. One
is coated with an anti-A antibody, one with an anti-B antibody, and one with an anti-D antibody (tests for the presence
of Rh factor D). Mixing a drop of blood and saline into each well enables the blood to interact with a preparation of
type-specific antibodies, also called anti-seras. Agglutination of RBCs in a given site indicates a positive identification
of the blood antigens, in this case A and Rh antigens for blood type A*. For the purpose of transfusion, the donor’s and
recipient's blood types must match.

ABO Transfusion Protocols

To avoid transfusion reactions, it is best to transfuse only matching blood types; that is, a type B” recipient should ideally

receive blood only from a type B* donor and so on. That said, in emergency situations, when acute hemorrhage threatens
the patient’s life, there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood type. In these cases, blood from a universal

donor—an individual with type O blood—may be transfused. Recall that type O erythrocytes do not display A or B
antigens. Thus, anti-A or anti-B antibodies that might be circulating in the patient’s blood plasma will not encounter any
erythrocyte surface antigens on the donated blood and therefore will not be provoked into a response. One problem with
this designation of universal donor is if the O- individual had prior exposure to Rh antigen, Rh antibodies may be present
in the donated blood. Also, introducing type O blood into an individual with type A, B, or AB blood will nevertheless
introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens, as these are always circulating in the type O blood plasma. This may
cause problems for the recipient, but because the volume of blood transfused is much lower than the volume of the patient’s
own blood, the adverse effects of the relatively few infused plasma antibodies are typically limited. Rh factor also plays a

role. If Rh individuals receiving blood have had prior exposure to Rh antigen, antibodies for this antigen may be present
in the blood and trigger agglutination to some degree. Although it is always preferable to cross match a patient’s blood
before transfusing, in a true life-threatening emergency situation, this is not always possible, and these procedures may be
implemented.

A patient with blood type AB” is known as the universal recipient. This patient can theoretically receive any type
of blood, because the patient’s own blood—having both A and B antigens on the erythrocyte surface—does not produce
anti-A or anti-B antibodies. In addition, an Rh” patient can receive both Rh* and Rh blood. However, keep in mind that
the donor’s blood will contain circulating antibodies, again with possible negative implications. Figure 18.17 summarizes
the blood types and compatibilities.

At the scene of multiple-vehicle accidents, military engagements, and natural or human-caused disasters, many
victims may suffer simultaneously from acute hemorrhage, yet type O blood may not be immediately available. In these
circumstances, medics may at least try to replace some of the volume of blood that has been lost. This is done by intravenous
administration of a saline solution that provides fluids and electrolytes in proportions equivalent to those of normal blood
plasma. Research is ongoing to develop a safe and effective artificial blood that would carry out the oxygen-carrying
function of blood without the RBCs, enabling transfusions in the field without concern for incompatibility. These blood
substitutes normally contain hemoglobin- as well as perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers.

CHAPTER REVIEW

18.1 An Overview of Blood

Blood is a fluid connective tissue critical to the transportation of nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout the body; to
defend the body against infection and other threats; and to the homeostatic regulation of pH, temperature, and other internal
conditions. Blood is composed of formed elements—erythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments called platelets—and
a fluid extracellular matrix called plasma. More than 90 percent of plasma is water. The remainder is mostly plasma

772 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD

proteins—mainly albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen—and other dissolved solutes such as glucose, lipids, electrolytes, and
dissolved gases. Because of the formed elements and the plasma proteins and other solutes, blood is sticky and more viscous
than water. It is also slightly alkaline, and its temperature is slightly higher than normal body temperature.

18.2 Production of the Formed Elements

Through the process of hemopoiesis, the formed elements of blood are continually produced, replacing the relatively short-
ived erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. Hemopoiesis begins in the red bone marrow, with hemopoietic stem cells that
differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Myeloid stem cells give rise to most of the formed elements. Lymphoid
stem cells give rise only to the various lymphocytes designated as B and T cells, and NK cells. Hemopoietic growth
‘actors, including erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, colony-stimulating factors, and interleukins, promote the proliferation
and differentiation of formed elements.

18.3 Erythrocytes

[he most abundant formed elements in blood, erythrocytes are red, biconcave disks packed with an oxygen-carrying
compound called hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins bound to a pigment molecule called
heme, which contains an ion of iron. In the bloodstream, iron picks up oxygen in the lungs and drops it off in the tissues;
the amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Erythrocytes live only 120
days on average, and thus must be continually replaced. Worn-out erythrocytes are phagocytized by macrophages and their
hemoglobin is broken down. The breakdown products are recycled or removed as wastes: Globin is broken down into amino
acids for synthesis of new proteins; iron is stored in the liver or spleen or used by the bone marrow for production of new
erythrocytes; and the remnants of heme are converted into bilirubin, or other waste products that are taken up by the liver
and excreted in the bile or removed by the kidneys. Anemia is a deficiency of RBCs or hemoglobin, whereas polycythemia
is an excess of RBCs.

18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets

Leukocytes function in body defenses. They squeeze out of the walls of blood vessels through emigration or diapedesis,
then may move through tissue fluid or become attached to various organs where they fight against pathogenic organisms,
diseased cells, or other threats to health. Granular leukocytes, which include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils,
originate with myeloid stem cells, as do the agranular monocytes. The other agranular leukocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T
cells, arise from the lymphoid stem cell line. The most abundant leukocytes are the neutrophils, which are first responders to
infections, especially with bacteria. About 20-30 percent of all leukocytes are lymphocytes, which are critical to the body’s
defense against specific threats. Leukemia and lymphoma are malignancies involving leukocytes. Platelets are fragments of
cells known as megakaryocytes that dwell within the bone marrow. While many platelets are stored in the spleen, others
enter the circulation and are essential for hemostasis; they also produce several growth factors important for repair and
healing.

18.5 Hemostasis

Hemostasis is the physiological process by which bleeding ceases. Hemostasis involves three basic steps: vascular spasm,
the formation of a platelet plug, and coagulation, in which clotting factors promote the formation of a fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis
is the process in which a clot is degraded in a healing vessel. Anticoagulants are substances that oppose coagulation.
They are important in limiting the extent and duration of clotting. Inadequate clotting can result from too few platelets,
or inadequate production of clotting factors, for instance, in the genetic disorder hemophilia. Excessive clotting, called
thrombosis, can be caused by excessive numbers of platelets. A thrombus is a collection of fibrin, platelets, and erythrocytes
that has accumulated along the lining of a blood vessel, whereas an embolus is a thrombus that has broken free from the
vessel wall and is circulating in the bloodstream.

18.6 Blood Typing

Antigens are nonself molecules, usually large proteins, which provoke an immune response. In transfusion reactions,
antibodies attach to antigens on the surfaces of erythrocytes and cause agglutination and hemolysis. ABO blood group
antigens are designated A and B. People with type A blood have A antigens on their erythrocytes, whereas those with type
B blood have B antigens. Those with AB blood have both A and B antigens, and those with type O blood have neither A
nor B antigens. The blood plasma contains preformed antibodies against the antigens not present on a person’s erythrocytes.

A second group of blood antigens is the Rh group, the most important of which is Rh D. People with Rh blood
do not have this antigen on their erythrocytes, whereas those who are Rh* do. About 85 percent of Americans are Rh”.
When a woman who is Rh” becomes pregnant with an Rh” fetus, her body may begin to produce anti-Rh antibodies. If she
subsequently becomes pregnant with a second Rh’ fetus and is not treated preventively with RhoGAM, the fetus will be

at risk for an antigen-antibody reaction, including agglutination and hemolysis. This is known as hemolytic disease of the
newborn.

* Describe the size, shape, and location of the heart

* Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle

¢ Explain the cardiac conduction system

778 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

* Describe the effects of exercise on cardiac output and heart rate

* Name the centers of the brain that control heart rate and describe their function
* Identify other factors affecting heart rate

* Describe fetal heart development

In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels. There is no single better
word to describe the function of the heart other than “pump,” since its contraction develops the pressure that ejects blood
into the major vessels: the aorta and pulmonary trunk. From these vessels, the blood is distributed to the remainder of the
body. Although the connotation of the term “pump” suggests a mechanical device made of steel and plastic, the anatomical
structure is a living, sophisticated muscle. As you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and
muscle.

Although the term “heart” is an English word, cardiac (heart-related) terminology can be traced back to the Latin term,
“kardia.” Cardiology is the study of the heart, and cardiologists are the physicians who deal primarily with the heart.

19.1 | Heart Anatomy

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the location and position of the heart within the body cavity
¢ Describe the internal and external anatomy of the heart

dentify the tissue layers of the heart

¢ Relate the structure of the heart to its function as a pump

* Compare systemic circulation to pulmonary circulation

¢ Identify the veins and arteries of the coronary circulation system

¢ Trace the pathway of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood thorough the chambers of the heart

The vital importance of the heart is obvious. If one assumes an average rate of contraction of 75 contractions per minute, a
human heart would contract approximately 108,000 times in one day, more than 39 million times in one year, and nearly 3
billion times during a 75-year lifespan. Each of the major pumping chambers of the heart ejects approximately 70 mL blood
per contraction in a resting adult. This would be equal to 5.25 liters of fluid per minute and approximately 14,000 liters per
day. Over one year, that would equal 10,000,000 liters or 2.6 million gallons of blood sent through roughly 60,000 miles of
vessels. In order to understand how that happens, it is necessary to understand the anatomy and physiology of the heart.

Location of the Heart

The human heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the space known as the mediastinum.
Figure 19.2 shows the position of the heart within the thoracic cavity. Within the mediastinum, the heart is separated from
the other mediastinal structures by a tough membrane known as the pericardium, or pericardial sac, and sits in its own space
called the pericardial cavity. The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the bodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior surface
sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages. The great veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the great arteries,
the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the superior surface of the heart, called the base. The base of the heart is
located at the level of the third costal cartilage, as seen in Figure 19.2. The inferior tip of the heart, the apex, lies just to the
left of the sternum between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages. The right
side of the heart is deflected anteriorly, and the left side is deflected posteriorly. It is important to remember the position
and orientation of the heart when placing a stethoscope on the chest of a patient and listening for heart sounds, and also
when looking at images taken from a midsagittal perspective. The slight deviation of the apex to the left is reflected in a
depression in the medial surface of the inferior lobe of the left lung, called the cardiac notch.

Everyday CONNECTION

CPR

The position of the heart in the torso between the vertebrae and sternum (see Figure 19.2 for the position of the heart
within the thorax) allows for individuals to apply an emergency technique known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) if the heart of a patient should stop. By applying pressure with the flat portion of one hand on the sternum in
the area between the line at T4 and T9 (Figure 19.3), it is possible to manually compress the blood within the heart
enough to push some of the blood within it into the pulmonary and systemic circuits. This is particularly critical for the
brain, as irreversible damage and death of neurons occur within minutes of loss of blood flow. Current standards call
for compression of the chest at least 5 cm deep and at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, a rate equal to the beat
in “Staying Alive,” recorded in 1977 by the Bee Gees. If you are unfamiliar with this song, a version is available on
www.youtube.com. At this stage, the emphasis is on performing high-quality chest compressions, rather than providing
artificial respiration. CPR is generally performed until the patient regains spontaneous contraction or is declared dead
by an experienced healthcare professional.

When performed by untrained or overzealous individuals, CPR can result in broken ribs or a broken sternum, and
can inflict additional severe damage on the patient. It is also possible, if the hands are placed too low on the sternum, to
manually drive the xiphoid process into the liver, a consequence that may prove fatal for the patient. Proper training is
essential. This proven life-sustaining technique is so valuable that virtually all medical personnel as well as concerned
members of the public should be certified and routinely recertified in its application. CPR courses are offered at a
variety of locations, including colleges, hospitals, the American Red Cross, and some commercial companies. They
normally include practice of the compression technique on a mannequin.

Figure 19.3 CPR Technique If the heart should stop, CPR can maintain the flow of blood until the heart resumes
beating. By applying pressure to the sternum, the blood within the heart will be squeezed out of the heart and into
the circulation. Proper positioning of the hands on the sternum to perform CPR would be between the lines at T4
and T9.

Shape and Size of the Heart

The shape of the heart is similar to a pinecone, rather broad at the superior surface and tapering to the apex (see Figure
19.2). A typical heart is approximately the size of your fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in)
in thickness. Given the size difference between most members of the sexes, the weight of a female heart is approximately
250-300 grams (9 to 11 ounces), and the weight of a male heart is approximately 300-350 grams (11 to 12 ounces).
The heart of a well-trained athlete, especially one specializing in aerobic sports, can be considerably larger than this.
Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to that of skeletal muscle. That is, exercise results in the addition
of protein myofilaments that increase the size of the individual cells without increasing their numbers, a concept called
hypertrophy. Hearts of athletes can pump blood more effectively at lower rates than those of nonathletes. Enlarged hearts
are not always a result of exercise; they can result from pathologies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cause
of an abnormally enlarged heart muscle is unknown, but the condition is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in
apparently otherwise healthy young people.

Chambers and Circulation through the Heart

The human heart consists of four chambers: The left side and the right side each have one atrium and one ventricle. Each
of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural = atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving chamber and contracts to
push blood into the lower chambers, the right ventricle and the left ventricle. The ventricles serve as the primary pumping
chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.
There are two distinct but linked circuits in the human circulation called the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Although
both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of view of gases.
The pulmonary circuit transports blood to and from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and delivers carbon dioxide for
exhalation. The systemic circuit transports oxygenated blood to virtually all of the tissues of the body and returns relatively
deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the heart to be sent back to the pulmonary circulation.

The right ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk, which leads toward the lungs and bifurcates
into the left and right pulmonary arteries. These vessels in turn branch many times before reaching the pulmonary
capillaries, where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters. The pulmonary trunk arteries
and their branches are the only arteries in the post-natal body that carry relatively deoxygenated blood. Highly oxygenated
blood returning from the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs passes through a series of vessels that join together to form the
pulmonary veins—the only post-natal veins in the body that carry highly oxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins conduct
blood into the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into the
aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit. Eventually, these vessels will lead to the systemic capillaries,
where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs. In this case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic
capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.

The blood exiting the systemic capillaries is lower in oxygen concentration than when it entered. The capillaries will
ultimately unite to form venules, joining to form ever-larger veins, eventually flowing into the two major systemic veins,
the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium. The blood in the superior
and inferior venae cavae flows into the right atrium, which pumps blood into the right ventricle. This process of blood
circulation continues as long as the individual remains alive. Understanding the flow of blood through the pulmonary and
systemic circuits is critical to all health professions (Figure 19.4).

Figure 19.4 Dual System of the Human Blood Circulation Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle,
where it is pumped into the pulmonary circuit. The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is low in oxygen but relatively
high in carbon dioxide. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out),
and blood high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From here, blood enters the left
ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit. Following exchange in the systemic capillaries (oxygen and nutrients
out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated.

Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers

Our exploration of more in-depth heart structures begins by examining the membrane that surrounds the heart, the
prominent surface features of the heart, and the layers that form the wall of the heart. Each of these components plays its
own unique role in terms of function.

Membranes

The membrane that directly surrounds the heart and defines the pericardial cavity is called the pericardium or pericardial
sac. It also surrounds the “roots” of the major vessels, or the areas of closest proximity to the heart. The pericardium, which
literally translates as “around the heart,” consists of two distinct sublayers: the sturdy outer fibrous pericardium and the
inner serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is made of tough, dense connective tissue that protects the heart and
maintains its position in the thorax. The more delicate serous pericardium consists of two layers: the parietal pericardium,
which is fused to the fibrous pericardium, and an inner visceral pericardium, or epicardium, which is fused to the heart
and is part of the heart wall. The pericardial cavity, filled with lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the
pericardium.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 783

In most organs within the body, visceral serous membranes such as the epicardium are microscopic. However, in the
case of the heart, it is not a microscopic layer but rather a macroscopic layer, consisting of a simple squamous epithelium
called a mesothelium, reinforced with loose, irregular, or areolar connective tissue that attaches to the pericardium. This
mesothelium secretes the lubricating serous fluid that fills the pericardial cavity and reduces friction as the heart contracts.
Figure 19.5 illustrates the pericardial membrane and the layers of the heart.

Heart: Cardiac Tamponade

If excess fluid builds within the pericardial space, it can lead to a condition called cardiac tamponade, or pericardial
tamponade. With each contraction of the heart, more fluid—in most instances, blood—accumulates within the
pericardial cavity. In order to fill with blood for the next contraction, the heart must relax. However, the excess fluid in
the pericardial cavity puts pressure on the heart and prevents full relaxation, so the chambers within the heart contain
slightly less blood as they begin each heart cycle. Over time, less and less blood is ejected from the heart. If the
fluid builds up slowly, as in hypothyroidism, the pericardial cavity may be able to expand gradually to accommodate
this extra volume. Some cases of fluid in excess of one liter within the pericardial cavity have been reported. Rapid
accumulation of as little as 100 mL of fluid following trauma may trigger cardiac tamponade. Other common causes
include myocardial rupture, pericarditis, cancer, or even cardiac surgery. Removal of this excess fluid requires insertion
of drainage tubes into the pericardial cavity. Premature removal of these drainage tubes, for example, following cardiac
surgery, or clot formation within these tubes are causes of this condition. Untreated, cardiac tamponade can lead to
death.

Surface Features of the Heart

Inside the pericardium, the surface features of the heart are visible, including the four chambers. There is a superficial leaf-
like extension of the atria near the superior surface of the heart, one on each side, called an auricle—a name that means “ear
like”—because its shape resembles the external ear of a human (Figure 19.6). Auricles are relatively thin-walled structures
that can fill with blood and empty into the atria or upper chambers of the heart. You may also hear them referred to as atrial
appendages. Also prominent is a series of fat-filled grooves, each of which is known as a sulcus (plural = sulci), along
the superior surfaces of the heart. Major coronary blood vessels are located in these sulci. The deep coronary sulcus is
located between the atria and ventricles. Located between the left and right ventricles are two additional sulci that are not
as deep as the coronary sulcus. The anterior interventricular sulcus is visible on the anterior surface of the heart, whereas

784 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

the posterior interventricular sulcus is visible on the posterior surface of the heart. Figure 19.6 illustrates anterior and

Layers

The wall of the heart is composed of three layers of unequal thickness. From superficial to deep, these are the epicardium,
the myocardium, and the endocardium (see Figure 19.5). The outermost layer of the wall of the heart is also the innermost
layer of the pericardium, the epicardium, or the visceral pericardium discussed earlier.

The middle and thickest layer is the myocardium, made largely of cardiac muscle cells. It is built upon a framework
of collagenous fibers, plus the blood vessels that supply the myocardium and the nerve fibers that help regulate the heart.
It is the contraction of the myocardium that pumps blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The muscle pattern
is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart. They form a figure 8 pattern
around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels. Deeper ventricular muscles also form a figure 8 around the two
ventricles and proceed toward the apex. More superficial layers of ventricular muscle wrap around both ventricles. This
complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively than a simple linear pattern would. Figure 19.7
illustrates the arrangement of muscle cells.

Figure 19.7 Heart Musculature The swirling pattern of cardiac muscle tissue contributes significantly to the heart’s
ability to pump blood effectively.

Although the ventricles on the right and left sides pump the same amount of blood per contraction, the muscle of the
left ventricle is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle. In order to overcome the high resistance
required to pump blood into the long systemic circuit, the left ventricle must generate a great amount of pressure. The right
ventricle does not need to generate as much pressure, since the pulmonary circuit is shorter and provides less resistance.
Figure 19.8 illustrates the differences in muscular thickness needed for each of the ventricles.

Left ventricle

Right ventricle

Figure 19.8 Differences in Ventricular Muscle Thickness The myometrium in the left ventricle is significantly
thicker than that of the right ventricle. Both ventricles pump the same amount of blood, but the left ventricle must
generate a much greater pressure to overcome greater resistance in the systemic circuit. The ventricles are shown
in both relaxed and contracting states. Note the differences in the relative size of the lumens, the region inside each
ventricle where the blood is contained.

The innermost layer of the heart wall, the endocardium, is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective
tissue. The endocardium lines the chambers where the blood circulates and covers the heart valves. It is made of simple
squamous epithelium called endothelium, which is continuous with the endothelial lining of the blood vessels (see Figure
19.5).

Once regarded as a simple lining layer, recent evidence indicates that the endothelium of the endocardium and
the coronary capillaries may play active roles in regulating the contraction of the muscle within the myocardium. The
endothelium may also regulate the growth patterns of the cardiac muscle cells throughout life, and the endothelins it
secretes create an environment in the surrounding tissue fluids that regulates ionic concentrations and states of contractility.

786 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictors and, in a normal individual, establish a homeostatic balance with other
vasoconstrictors and vasodilators.

Internal Structure of the Heart

Recall that the heart’s contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulation—the pulmonary and systemic
circuits—because of the pairs of chambers that pump blood into the circulation. In order to develop a more precise
understanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail.

Septa of the Heart

The word septum is derived from the Latin for “something that encloses;” in this case, a septum (plural = septa) refers to
a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers. The septa are physical extensions of the myocardium lined with
endocardium. Located between the two atria is the interatrial septum. Normally in an adult heart, the interatrial septum
bears an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen
ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing
some blood to bypass the pulmonary circuit. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that
previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern.

Between the two ventricles is a second septum known as the interventricular septum. Unlike the interatrial septum,
the interventricular septum is normally intact after its formation during fetal development. It is substantially thicker than the
interatrial septum, since the ventricles generate far greater pressure when they contract.

The septum between the atria and ventricles is known as the atrioventricular septum. It is marked by the presence
of four openings that allow blood to move from the atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles into the pulmonary
trunk and aorta. Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles is a valve, a specialized structure that
ensures one-way flow of blood. The valves between the atria and ventricles are known generically as atrioventricular
valves. The valves at the openings that lead to the pulmonary trunk and aorta are known generically as semilunar valves.
The interventricular septum is visible in Figure 19.9. In this figure, the atrioventricular septum has been removed to better
show the bicupid and tricuspid valves; the interatrial septum is not visible, since its location is covered by the aorta and
pulmonary trunk. Since these openings and valves structurally weaken the atrioventricular septum, the remaining tissue is
heavily reinforced with dense connective tissue called the cardiac skeleton, or skeleton of the heart. It includes four rings
that surround the openings between the atria and ventricles, and the openings to the pulmonary trunk and aorta, and serve as
the point of attachment for the heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart electrical
conduction system.

Heart: Heart Defects

One very common form of interatrial septum pathology is patent foramen ovale, which occurs when the septum
primum does not close at birth, and the fossa ovalis is unable to fuse. The word patent is from the Latin root patens for
“open.” It may be benign or asymptomatic, perhaps never being diagnosed, or in extreme cases, it may require surgical
repair to close the opening permanently. As much as 20-25 percent of the general population may have a patent
foramen ovale, but fortunately, most have the benign, asymptomatic version. Patent foramen ovale is normally detected
by auscultation of a heart murmur (an abnormal heart sound) and confirmed by imaging with an echocardiogram.
Despite its prevalence in the general population, the causes of patent ovale are unknown, and there are no known risk
factors. In nonlife-threatening cases, it is better to monitor the condition than to risk heart surgery to repair and seal the
opening.

Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormal narrowing of the aorta that is normally located at the insertion
of the ligamentum arteriosum, the remnant of the fetal shunt called the ductus arteriosus. If severe, this condition
drastically restricts blood flow through the primary systemic artery, which is life threatening. In some individuals, the
condition may be fairly benign and not detected until later in life. Detectable symptoms in an infant include difficulty
breathing, poor appetite, trouble feeding, or failure to thrive. In older individuals, symptoms include dizziness, fainting,
shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and nosebleeds. Treatment involves surgery to resect (remove) the
affected region or angioplasty to open the abnormally narrow passageway. Studies have shown that the earlier the
surgery is performed, the better the chance of survival.

A patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close. The condition
may range from severe to benign. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in blood flowing from the higher
pressure aorta into the lower pressure pulmonary trunk. This additional fluid moving toward the lungs increases
pulmonary pressure and makes respiration difficult. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia,
enlarged heart, a widened pulse pressure, and poor weight gain in infants. Treatments include surgical closure
(ligation), manual closure using platinum coils or specialized mesh inserted via the femoral artery or vein, or
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to block the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which maintains the vessel in an open
position. If untreated, the condition can result in congestive heart failure.

Septal defects are not uncommon in individuals and may be congenital or caused by various disease processes.
Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital condition that may also occur from exposure to unknown environmental factors; it
occurs when there is an opening in the interventricular septum caused by blockage of the pulmonary trunk, normally
at the pulmonary semilunar valve. This allows blood that is relatively low in oxygen from the right ventricle to flow
into the left ventricle and mix with the blood that is relatively high in oxygen. Symptoms include a distinct heart
murmur, low blood oxygen percent saturation, dyspnea or difficulty in breathing, polycythemia, broadening (clubbing)
of the fingers and toes, and in children, difficulty in feeding or failure to grow and develop. It is the most common
cause of cyanosis following birth. The term “tetralogy” is derived from the four components of the condition, although
only three may be present in an individual patient: pulmonary infundibular stenosis (rigidity of the pulmonary valve),
overriding aorta (the aorta is shifted above both ventricles), ventricular septal defect (opening), and right ventricular
hypertrophy (enlargement of the right ventricle). Other heart defects may also accompany this condition, which is
typically confirmed by echocardiography imaging. Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in approximately 400 out of one million
live births. Normal treatment involves extensive surgical repair, including the use of stents to redirect blood flow and
replacement of valves and patches to repair the septal defect, but the condition has a relatively high mortality. Survival
rates are currently 75 percent during the first year of life; 60 percent by 4 years of age; 30 percent by 10 years; and 5
percent by 40 years.

In the case of severe septal defects, including both tetralogy of Fallot and patent foramen ovale, failure of the
heart to develop properly can lead to a condition commonly known as a “blue baby.” Regardless of normal skin
pigmentation, individuals with this condition have an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood, which leads to cyanosis,
a blue or purple coloration of the skin, especially when active.

Septal defects are commonly first detected through auscultation, listening to the chest using a stethoscope. In this
case, instead of hearing normal heart sounds attributed to the flow of blood and closing of heart valves, unusual heart
sounds may be detected. This is often followed by medical imaging to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. In many cases,
treatment may not be needed. Some common congenital heart defects are illustrated in Figure 19.10.

Tetralogy of Fallot includes an abnormal opening in the interventricular septum.

Right Atrium

The right atrium serves as the receiving chamber for blood returning to the heart from the systemic circulation. The two
major systemic veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the large coronary vein called the coronary sinus that
drains the heart myocardium empty into the right atrium. The superior vena cava drains blood from regions superior to the
diaphragm: the head, neck, upper limbs, and the thoracic region. It empties into the superior and posterior portions of the
right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains blood from areas inferior to the diaphragm: the lower limbs and abdominopelvic
region of the body. It, too, empties into the posterior portion of the atria, but inferior to the opening of the superior vena cava.
Immediately superior and slightly medial to the opening of the inferior vena cava on the posterior surface of the atrium is
the opening of the coronary sinus. This thin-walled vessel drains most of the coronary veins that return systemic blood from
the heart. The majority of the internal heart structures discussed in this and subsequent sections are illustrated in Figure
19.9.

While the bulk of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the
anterior surface demonstrates prominent ridges of muscle called the pectinate muscles. The right auricle also has pectinate
muscles. The left atrium does not have pectinate muscles except in the auricle.

The atria receive venous blood on a nearly continuous basis, preventing venous flow from stopping while the ventricles
are contracting. While most ventricular filling occurs while the atria are relaxed, they do demonstrate a contractile phase and
actively pump blood into the ventricles just prior to ventricular contraction. The opening between the atrium and ventricle
is guarded by the tricuspid valve.

Right Ventricle

The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Each flap of the valve is attached
to strong strands of connective tissue, the chordae tendineae, literally “tendinous cords,” or sometimes more poetically
referred to as “heart strings.” There are several chordae tendineae associated with each of the flaps. They are composed of
approximately 80 percent collagenous fibers with the remainder consisting of elastic fibers and endothelium. They connect
each of the flaps to a papillary muscle that extends from the inferior ventricular surface. There are three papillary muscles
in the right ventricle, called the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, which correspond to the three sections of the valves.

When the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, pressure within the ventricular chamber rises. Blood, like any fluid,
flows from higher pressure to lower pressure areas, in this case, toward the pulmonary trunk and the atrium. To prevent any
potential backflow, the papillary muscles also contract, generating tension on the chordae tendineae. This prevents the flaps
of the valves from being forced into the atria and regurgitation of the blood back into the atria during ventricular contraction.
Figure 19.11 shows papillary muscles and chordae tendineae attached to the tricuspid valve.

attached to the tricuspid valve on the right as well as the mitral valve on the left via chordae tendineae. (credit:
modification of work by “PV KS”/flickr.com)

The walls of the ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In
addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band
(see Figure 19.9) reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from
the inferior portion of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the
inferior papillary muscle.

When the right ventricle contracts, it ejects blood into the pulmonary trunk, which branches into the left and right
pulmonary arteries that carry it to each lung. The superior surface of the right ventricle begins to taper as it approaches the
pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve that prevents backflow from the
pulmonary trunk.

Left Atrium

After exchange of gases in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium high in oxygen via one of the
‘our pulmonary veins. While the left atrium does not contain pectinate muscles, it does have an auricle that includes
these pectinate ridges. Blood flows nearly continuously from the pulmonary veins back into the atrium, which acts as the
receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while
both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract,
pumping blood into the ventricle. This atrial contraction accounts for approximately 20 percent of ventricular filling. The
opening between the left atrium and ventricle is guarded by the mitral valve.

Left Ventricle

Recall that, although both sides of the heart will pump the same amount of blood, the muscular layer is much thicker in the
left ventricle compared to the right (see Figure 19.8). Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there
is no moderator band. The mitral valve is connected to papillary muscles via chordae tendineae. There are two papillary
muscles on the left—the anterior and posterior—as opposed to three on the right.

The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic
semilunar valve.

Heart Valve Structure and Function

A transverse section through the heart slightly above the level of the atrioventricular septum reveals all four heart valves
along the same plane (Figure 19.12). The valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart. Between the right
atrium and the right ventricle is the right atrioventricular valve, or tricuspid valve. It typically consists of three flaps, or
leaflets, made of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue. The flaps are connected by chordae tendineae
to the papillary muscles, which control the opening and closing of the valves.

Figure 19.12 Heart Valves With the atria and major vessels removed, all four valves are clearly visible, although it
difficult to distinguish the three separate cusps of the tricuspid valve.

Emerging from the right ventricle at the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, or tl

pulmonary valve; it is also known as the pulmonic valve or the right semilunar valve. The pulmonary valve is comprised
of three small flaps of endothelium reinforced with connective tissue. When the ventricle relaxes, the pressure differential

causes blood to flow back into the ventricle from the pulmonary trunk. This flow of blood fills the pocket-like flaps of t

pulmonary valve, causing the valve to close and producing an audible sound. Unlike the atrioventricular valves, there are

no papillary muscles or chordae tendineae associated with the pulmonary valve.

Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve, also called the bicuspid valve

or the left atrioventricular valve. Structurally, this valve consists of two cusps, known as the anterior medial cusp and tl
posterior medial cusp, compared to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve. In a clinical setting, the valve is referred to

the mitral valve, rather than the bicuspid valve. The two cusps of the mitral valve are attached by chordae tendineae to two

papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle.

At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or the aortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta.
normally is composed of three flaps. When the ventricle relaxes and blood attempts to flow back into the ventricle from t
aorta, blood will fill the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing an audible sound.

(bicuspid) valve that prevents backflow of blood into the left atrium. The aortic semilunar valve is open to allow blood
to be ejected into the aorta.

When the ventricles begin to contract, pressure within the ventricles rises and blood flows toward the area of lowest
pressure, which is initially in the atria. This backflow causes the cusps of the tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid) valves to close.
These valves are tied down to the papillary muscles by chordae tendineae. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle,
the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight (see Figure 19.13b). However, as
the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae (see
Figure 19.14b), helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown
back into the atria.

The aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves lack the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles associated with the
atrioventricular valves. Instead, they consist of pocket-like folds of endocardium reinforced with additional connective
tissue. When the ventricles relax and the change in pressure forces the blood toward the ventricles, the blood presses against
these cusps and seals the openings.

why is their presence more critical for the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral) than the semilunar (aortic and
pulmonary) valves?

Heart Valves

When heart valves do not function properly, they are often described as incompetent and result in valvular heart
disease, which can range from benign to lethal. Some of these conditions are congenital, that is, the individual was
born with the defect, whereas others may be attributed to disease processes or trauma. Some malfunctions are treated
with medications, others require surgery, and still others may be mild enough that the condition is merely monitored
since treatment might trigger more serious consequences.

Valvular disorders are often caused by carditis, or inflammation of the heart. One common trigger for this
inflammation is rheumatic fever, or scarlet fever, an autoimmune response to the presence of a bacterium,
Streptococcus pyogenes, normally a disease of childhood.

While any of the heart valves may be involved in valve disorders, mitral regurgitation is the most common,
detected in approximately 2 percent of the population, and the pulmonary semilunar valve is the least frequently
involved. When a valve malfunctions, the flow of blood to a region will often be disrupted. The resulting inadequate
flow of blood to this region will be described in general terms as an insufficiency. The specific type of insufficiency
is named for the valve involved: aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, tricuspid insufficiency, or pulmonary
insufficiency.

If one of the cusps of the valve is forced backward by the force of the blood, the condition is referred to as a
prolapsed valve. Prolapse may occur if the chordae tendineae are damaged or broken, causing the closure mechanism
to fail. The failure of the valve to close properly disrupts the normal one-way flow of blood and results in regurgitation,
when the blood flows backward from its normal path. Using a stethoscope, the disruption to the normal flow of blood
produces a heart murmur.

Stenosis is a condition in which the heart valves become rigid and may calcify over time. The loss of flexibility
of the valve interferes with normal function and may cause the heart to work harder to propel blood through the valve,
which eventually weakens the heart. Aortic stenosis affects approximately 2 percent of the population over 65 years of
age, and the percentage increases to approximately 4 percent in individuals over 85 years. Occasionally, one or more
of the chordae tendineae will tear or the papillary muscle itself may die as a component of a myocardial infarction
(heart attack). In this case, the patient’s condition will deteriorate dramatically and rapidly, and immediate surgical
intervention may be required.

Auscultation, or listening to a patient’s heart sounds, is one of the most useful diagnostic tools, since it is proven,
safe, and inexpensive. The term auscultation is derived from the Latin for “to listen,” and the technique has been used
for diagnostic purposes as far back as the ancient Egyptians. Valve and septal disorders will trigger abnormal heart
sounds. If a valvular disorder is detected or suspected, a test called an echocardiogram, or simply an “echo,” may be
ordered. Echocardiograms are sonograms of the heart and can help in the diagnosis of valve disorders as well as a wide
variety of heart pathologies.

Cardiologist

Cardiologists are medical doctors that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the heart. After
completing 4 years of medical school, cardiologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed
by an additional three or more years in cardiology. Following this 10-year period of medical training and clinical
experience, they qualify for a rigorous two-day examination administered by the Board of Internal Medicine that
tests their academic training and clinical abilities, including diagnostics and treatment. After successful completion
of this examination, a physician becomes a board-certified cardiologist. Some board-certified cardiologists may
be invited to become a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology (FACC). This professional recognition is
awarded to outstanding physicians based upon merit, including outstanding credentials, achievements, and community
contributions to cardiovascular medicine.

Coronary Circulation

You will recall that the heart is a remarkable pump composed largely of cardiac muscle cells that are incredibly active
throughout life. Like all other cells, a cardiomyocyte requires a reliable supply of oxygen and nutrients, and a way to
remove wastes, so it needs a dedicated, complex, and extensive coronary circulation. And because of the critical and nearly
ceaseless activity of the heart throughout life, this need for a blood supply is even greater than for a typical cell. However,
coronary circulation is not continuous; rather, it cycles, reaching a peak when the heart muscle is relaxed and nearly ceasing
while it is contracting.

Coronary Arteries

Coronary arteries supply blood to the myocardium and other components of the heart. The first portion of the aorta after
it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries. There are three dilations in the wall of the aorta just
superior to the aortic semilunar valve. Two of these, the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic sinus, give rise to the
left and right coronary arteries, respectively. The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus, typically does not give rise
to a vessel. Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow the sulci are called epicardial
coronary arteries.

The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the
interventricular septum. The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus to
the left. Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The larger anterior interventricular
artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary
artery. It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the way it gives rise to numerous
smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses. An
anastomosis is an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally allow blood to circulate to a region even
if there may be partial blockage in another branch. The anastomoses in the heart are very small. Therefore, this ability is
somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in death of the cells (myocardial infarction)
supplied by the particular vessel.

The right coronary artery proceeds along the coronary sulcus and distributes blood to the right atrium, portions of both
ventricles, and the heart conduction system. Normally, one or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary artery

796 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

inferior to the right atrium. The marginal arteries supply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle. On the
posterior surface of the heart, the right coronary artery gives rise to the posterior interventricular artery, also known as
the posterior descending artery. It runs along the posterior portion of the interventricular sulcus toward the apex of the heart,
giving rise to branches that supply the interventricular septum and portions of both ventricles. Figure 19.15 presents views
of the coronary circulation from both the anterior and posterior views.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 797

Diseases (OF THE...

Heart: Myocardial Infarction

Myocardial infarction (MI) is the formal term for what is commonly referred to as a heart attack. It normally results
from a lack of blood flow (ischemia) and oxygen (hypoxia) to a region of the heart, resulting in death of the cardiac
muscle cells. An MI often occurs when a coronary artery is blocked by the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque consisting
of lipids, cholesterol and fatty acids, and white blood cells, primarily macrophages. It can also occur when a portion of
an unstable atherosclerotic plaque travels through the coronary arterial system and lodges in one of the smaller vessels.
The resulting blockage restricts the flow of blood and oxygen to the myocardium and causes death of the tissue. MIs
may be triggered by excessive exercise, in which the partially occluded artery is no longer able to pump sufficient
quantities of blood, or severe stress, which may induce spasm of the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel.

In the case of acute MI, there is often sudden pain beneath the sternum (retrosternal pain) called angina pectoris,
often radiating down the left arm in males but not in female patients. Until this anomaly between the sexes was
discovered, many female patients suffering MIs were misdiagnosed and sent home. In addition, patients typically
present with difficulty breathing and shortness of breath (dyspnea), irregular heartbeat (palpations), nausea and
vomiting, sweating (diaphoresis), anxiety, and fainting (syncope), although not all of these symptoms may be present.
Many of the symptoms are shared with other medical conditions, including anxiety attacks and simple indigestion, so
differential diagnosis is critical. It is estimated that between 22 and 64 percent of MIs present without any symptoms.

An MI can be confirmed by examining the patient’s ECG, which frequently reveals alterations in the ST and
Q components. Some classification schemes of MI are referred to as ST-elevated MI (STEMI) and non-elevated MI
(non-STEMI). In addition, echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be employed. Common
blood tests indicating an MI include elevated levels of creatine kinase MB (an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion
of creatine to phosphocreatine, consuming ATP) and cardiac troponin (the regulatory protein for muscle contraction),
both of which are released by damaged cardiac muscle cells.

Immediate treatments for MI are essential and include administering supplemental oxygen, aspirin that helps to
break up clots, and nitroglycerine administered sublingually (under the tongue) to facilitate its absorption. Despite
its unquestioned success in treatments and use since the 1880s, the mechanism of nitroglycerine is still incompletely
understood but is believed to involve the release of nitric oxide, a known vasodilator, and endothelium-derived
releasing factor, which also relaxes the smooth muscle in the tunica media of coronary vessels. Longer-term treatments
include injections of thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase that dissolve the clot, the anticoagulant heparin, balloon
angioplasty and stents to open blocked vessels, and bypass surgery to allow blood to pass around the site of blockage. If
the damage is extensive, coronary replacement with a donor heart or coronary assist device, a sophisticated mechanical
device that supplements the pumping activity of the heart, may be employed. Despite the attention, development of
artificial hearts to augment the severely limited supply of heart donors has proven less than satisfactory but will likely
improve in the future.

MIs may trigger cardiac arrest, but the two are not synonymous. Important risk factors for MI include
cardiovascular disease, age, smoking, high blood levels of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL, often referred to as “bad”
cholesterol), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good” cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, lack of physical exercise, chronic kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of illegal drugs.

Coronary Veins

Coronary veins drain the heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries (see Figure 19.15). The great cardiac
vein can be seen initially on the surface of the heart following the interventricular sulcus, but it eventually flows along
the coronary sulcus into the coronary sinus on the posterior surface. The great cardiac vein initially parallels the anterior
interventricular artery and drains the areas supplied by this vessel. It receives several major branches, including the posterior
cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, and the small cardiac vein. The posterior cardiac vein parallels and drains the
areas supplied by the marginal artery branch of the circumflex artery. The middle cardiac vein parallels and drains the
areas supplied by the posterior interventricular artery. The small cardiac vein parallels the right coronary artery and drains
the blood from the posterior surfaces of the right atrium and ventricle. The coronary sinus is a large, thin-walled vein on
the posterior surface of the heart lying within the atrioventricular sulcus and emptying directly into the right atrium. The
anterior cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries and drain the anterior surface of the right ventricle. Unlike these
other cardiac veins, it bypasses the coronary sinus and drains directly into the right atrium.

798 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

isorders OF THE...

Heart: Coronary Artery Disease

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. It occurs when the buildup of plaque—a fatty material
including cholesterol, connective tissue, white blood cells, and some smooth muscle cells—within the walls of the
arteries obstructs the flow of blood and decreases the flexibility or compliance of the vessels. This condition is called
atherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries that involves the accumulation of plaque. As the coronary blood vessels
become occluded, the flow of blood to the tissues will be restricted, a condition called ischemia that causes the cells
to receive insufficient amounts of oxygen, called hypoxia. Figure 19.16 shows the blockage of coronary arteries
highlighted by the injection of dye. Some individuals with coronary artery disease report pain radiating from the chest
called angina pectoris, but others remain asymptomatic. If untreated, coronary artery disease can lead to MI or a heart
attack.

Blockage of common trunk ~~

Figure 19.16 Atherosclerotic Coronary Arteries In this coronary angiogram (X-ray), the dye makes visible two
occluded coronary arteries. Such blockages can lead to decreased blood flow (ischemia) and insufficient oxygen
(hypoxia) delivered to the cardiac tissues. If uncorrected, this can lead to cardiac muscle death (myocardial
infarction).

The disease progresses slowly and often begins in children and can be seen as fatty “streaks” in the vessels. It
then gradually progresses throughout life. Well-documented risk factors include smoking, family history, hypertension,
obesity, diabetes, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, stress, and hyperlipidemia or high circulating levels
of lipids in the blood. Treatments may include medication, changes to diet and exercise, angioplasty with a balloon
catheter, insertion of a stent, or coronary bypass procedure.

Angioplasty is a procedure in which the occlusion is mechanically widened with a balloon. A specialized catheter
with an expandable tip is inserted into a superficial vessel, normally in the leg, and then directed to the site of the
occlusion. At this point, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque material and to open the vessel to increase blood
flow. Then, the balloon is deflated and retracted. A stent consisting of a specialized mesh is typically inserted at the
site of occlusion to reinforce the weakened and damaged walls. Stent insertions have been routine in cardiology for
more than 40 years.

Coronary bypass surgery may also be performed. This surgical procedure grafts a replacement vessel obtained
from another, less vital portion of the body to bypass the occluded area. This procedure is clearly effective in treating
patients experiencing a MI, but overall does not increase longevity. Nor does it seem advisable in patients with stable

although diminished cardiac capacity since frequently loss of mental acuity occurs following the procedure. Long-term
changes to behavior, emphasizing diet and exercise plus a medicine regime tailored to lower blood pressure, lower
cholesterol and lipids, and reduce clotting are equally as effective.

19.2 | Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the structure of cardiac muscle
¢ Identify and describe the components of the conducting system that distributes electrical impulses through the heart
* Compare the effect of ion movement on membrane potential of cardiac conductive and contractile cells
¢ Relate characteristics of an electrocardiogram to events in the cardiac cycle
¢ Identify blocks that can interrupt the cardiac cycle

Recall that cardiac muscle shares a few characteristics with both skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but it has some unique
properties of its own. Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an electrical potential at a fixed
rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contractile mechanism. This property is known as autorhythmicity.
Neither smooth nor skeletal muscle can do this. Even though cardiac muscle has autorhythmicity, heart rate is modulated by
the endocrine and nervous systems.

There are two major types of cardiac muscle cells: myocardial contractile cells and myocardial conducting cells. The
myocardial contractile cells constitute the bulk (99 percent) of the cells in the atria and ventricles. Contractile cells conduct
impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump blood through the body. The myocardial conducting cells (1
percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the heart. Except for Purkinje cells, they are generally much smaller
than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed for contraction. Their function is similar in
many respects to neurons, although they are specialized muscle cells. Myocardial conduction cells initiate and propagate the
action potential (the electrical impulse) that travels throughout the heart and triggers the contractions that propel the blood.

Structure of Cardiac Muscle

Compared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably shorter with
much smaller diameters. Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating pattern of dark A bands and light I
bands attributed to the precise arrangement of the myofilaments and fibrils that are organized in sarcomeres along the length
of the cell (Figure 19.17a). These contractile elements are virtually identical to skeletal muscle. T (transverse) tubules
penetrate from the surface plasma membrane, the sarcolemma, to the interior of the cell, allowing the electrical impulse to
reach the interior. The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in skeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of
the A and I bands. Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules in cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle. In addition, the
sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few calcium ions, so most of the calcium ions must come from outside the cells. The result
is a slower onset of contraction. Mitochondria are plentiful, providing energy for the contractions of the heart. Typically,
cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or more nuclei may be found in some cells.

Cardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure called an
intercalated disc, which helps support the synchronized contraction of the muscle (Figure 19.17b). The sarcolemmas from
adjacent cells bind together at the intercalated discs. They consist of desmosomes, specialized linking proteoglycans, tight
junctions, and large numbers of gap junctions that allow the passage of ions between the cells and help to synchronize the
contraction (Figure 19.17c). Intercellular connective tissue also helps to bind the cells together. The importance of strongly
binding these cells together is necessitated by the forces exerted by contraction.

Cardiac muscle undergoes aerobic respiration patterns, primarily metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Myoglobin,
lipids, and glycogen are all stored within the cytoplasm. Cardiac muscle cells undergo twitch-type contractions with long
refractory periods followed by brief relaxation periods. The relaxation is essential so the heart can fill with blood for the
next cycle. The refractory period is very long to prevent the possibility of tetany, a condition in which muscle remains
involuntarily contracted. In the heart, tetany is not compatible with life, since it would prevent the heart from pumping
blood.

Repair and Replacement

Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via
mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and
at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the
original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced
by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show
some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore
full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date,
myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells seem to be nonfunctional, although those
grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat. Perhaps soon this mystery will be solved, and new advances in treatment will
be commonplace.

Conduction System of the Heart

If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive, each is capable of generating its own electrical
impulse followed by contraction. When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are placed together,
the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to trigger a
contraction. As more cells are joined together, the fastest cell continues to assume control of the rate. A fully developed adult
heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse, triggered by the fastest cells, as part of the cardiac
conduction system. The components of the cardiac conduction system include the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node,
the atrioventricular bundle, the atrioventricular bundle branches, and the Purkinje cells (Figure 19.18).

branches, and the Purkinje fibers.

Sinoatrial (SA) Node

Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized clump of myocardial conducting cel
located in the superior and posterior walls of the right atrium in close proximity to the orifice of the superior vena cava. The
SA node has the highest inherent rate of depolarization and is known as the pacemaker of the heart. It initiates the sinus
rhythm, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.

This impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the atria through specialized internodal pathways,
to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node. The internodal pathways consist of three bands
(anterior, middle, and posterior) that lead directly from the SA node to the next node in the conduction system, the
atrioventricular node (see Figure 19.18). The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two

a


802 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

nodes. The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node
simply following the cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there
is a specialized pathway called Bachmann’s bundle or the interatrial band that conducts the impulse directly from the
right atrium to the left atrium. Regardless of the pathway, as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum, the connective
tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the
atrioventricular node. Figure 19.19 illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse

throughout the atria to the atrioventricular node.

bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers, and also reaches the right papillary muscle via the moderator band.
(5) The impulse spreads to the contractile fibers of the ventricle. (6) Ventricular contraction begins.

©

The electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for muscular contraction. The wave of depolarization
begins in the right atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through the
contractile cells. The contractile cells then begin contraction from the superior to the inferior portions of the atria, efficiently
pumping blood into the ventricles.

Atrioventricular (AV) Node

The atrioventricular (AV) node is a second clump of specialized myocardial conductive cells, located in the inferior
portion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular septum. The septum prevents the impulse from spreading directly to
the ventricles without passing through the AV node. There is a critical pause before the AV node depolarizes and transmits
the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle (see Figure 19.19, step 3). This delay in transmission is partially attributable to
the small diameter of the cells of the node, which slow the impulse. Also, conduction between nodal cells is less efficient
than between conducting cells. These factors mean that it takes the impulse approximately 100 ms to pass through the node.
This pause is critical to heart function, as it allows the atrial cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood
into the ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself. With extreme stimulation by the SA
node, the AV node can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute. This establishes the typical maximum heart rate in
a healthy young individual. Damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these rates, the
heart can no longer effectively pump blood.

Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers

Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum
before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle branches. The left

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 803

bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right
ventricle. Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the
right. Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply the right papillary muscles. Because
of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract
simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow
tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular contraction. There is no corresponding moderator band
on the left. Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see
Figure 19.19, step 4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms.

The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile
cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum
and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of
the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the
contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from
the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The total time
elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.

Membrane Potentials and lon Movement in Cardiac Conductive Cells

Action potentials are considerably different between cardiac conductive cells and cardiac contractive cells. While Na* and

K* play essential roles, Ca?" is also critical for both types of cells. Unlike skeletal muscles and neurons, cardiac conductive
cells do not have a stable resting potential. Conductive cells contain a series of sodium ion channels that allow a normal and
slow influx of sodium ions that causes the membrane potential to rise slowly from an initial value of -60 mV up to about
—40 mV. The resulting movement of sodium ions creates spontaneous depolarization (or prepotential depolarization).

At this point, calcium ion channels open and Ca?* enters the cell, further depolarizing it at a more rapid rate until it reaches
a value of approximately +5 mV. At this point, the calcium ion channels close and K* channels open, allowing outflux 0

K* and resulting in repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately —60 mV, the K* channels close and

Na® channels open, and the prepotential phase begins again. This phenomenon explains the autorhythmicity properties o
cardiac muscle (Figure 19.20).

threshold is reached followed by a rapid depolarization and repolarization. The prepotential accounts for the membrane
reaching threshold and initiates the spontaneous depolarization and contraction of the cell. Note the lack of a resting
potential.

Membrane Potentials and lon Movement in Cardiac Contractile Cells

There is a distinctly different electrical pattern involving the contractile cells. In this case, there is a rapid depolarization,
followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization. This phenomenon accounts for the long refractory periods required
for the cardiac muscle cells to pump blood effectively before they are capable of firing for a second time. These cardiac
myocytes normally do not initiate their own electrical potential, although they are capable of doing so, but rather wait for
an impulse to reach them.

Contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately -80 mV for
cells in the atria and -90 mV for cells in the ventricles. Despite this initial difference, the other components of their action
potentials are virtually identical. In both cases, when stimulated by an action potential, voltage-gated channels rapidly
open, beginning the positive-feedback mechanism of depolarization. This rapid influx of positively charged ions raises the
membrane potential to approximately +30 mV, at which point the sodium channels close. The rapid depolarization period
typically lasts 3-5 ms. Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which membrane potential declines relatively

slowly. This is due in large part to the opening of the slow Ca** channels, allowing Ca** to enter the cell while few K*

804 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

channels are open, allowing K* to exit the cell. The relatively long plateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms. Once the

membrane potential reaches approximately zero, the Ca** channels close and K* channels open, allowing K* to exit the
cell. The repolarization lasts approximately 75 ms. At this point, membrane potential drops until it reaches resting levels
once more and the cycle repeats. The entire event lasts between 250 and 300 ms (Figure 19.21).

The absolute refractory period for cardiac contractile muscle lasts approximately 200 ms, and the relative refractory
period lasts approximately 50 ms, for a total of 250 ms. This extended period is critical, since the heart muscle must contract
to pump blood effectively and the contraction must follow the electrical events. Without extended refractory periods,
premature contractions would occur in the heart and would not be compatible with life.

(b) The action potential for heart muscle is compared to that of skeletal muscle.

Calcium lons

Calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac muscle. Their influx through slow calcium channels
accounts for the prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period that enable cardiac muscle to function properly.
Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex; this complex
removes the inhibition that prevents the heads of the myosin molecules from forming cross bridges with the active sites
on actin that provide the power stroke of contraction. This mechanism is virtually identical to that of skeletal muscle.
Approximately 20 percent of the calcium required for contraction is supplied by the influx of Ca** during the plateau phase.

The remaining Ca?* for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
Comparative Rates of Conduction System Firing

The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just
described, are seen in the SA node and a few other conductive cells in the heart. Since the SA node is the pacemaker, it
reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system. It will initiate the impulses spreading to the

other conducting cells. The SA node, without nervous or endocrine control, would initiate a heart impulse approximately
80-100 times per minute. Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse,
the rate progressively slows as you proceed from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers. Without the SA node, the AV node
would generate a heart rate of 40-60 beats per minute. If the AV node were blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire
at a rate of approximately 30-40 impulses per minute. The bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20-30 impulses
per minute, and the Purkinje fibers would fire at 15-20 impulses per minute. While a few exceptionally trained aerobic
athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 30-40 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per
minute for Miguel Indurain, a cyclist), for most individuals, rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition
called bradycardia. Depending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much below this level, the heart would be unable
to maintain adequate flow of blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems,
unconsciousness, and ultimately death.

Electrocardiogram

By careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the complex, compound electrical signal of
the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram (ECG), also commonly abbreviated EKG (K coming
kardiology, from the German term for cardiology). Careful analysis of the ECG reveals a detailed picture of both normal and
abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable clinical diagnostic tool. The standard electrocardiograph (the instrument
that generates an ECG) uses 3, 5, or 12 leads. The greater the number of leads an electrocardiograph uses, the more
information the ECG provides. The term “lead” may be used to refer to the cable from the electrode to the electrical recorder,
but it typically describes the voltage difference between two of the electrodes. The 12-lead electrocardiograph uses 10
electrodes placed in standard locations on the patient’s skin (Figure 19.22). In continuous ambulatory electrocardiographs,
the patient wears a small, portable, battery-operated device known as a Holter monitor, or simply a Holter, that continuously
monitors heart electrical activity, typically for a period of 24 hours during the patient’s normal routine.

806 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Figure 19.22 Standard Placement of ECG Leads Ina 12-lead ECG, six electrodes are placed on the chest, and
four electrodes are placed on the limbs.

A normal ECG tracing is presented in Figure 19.23. Each component, segment, and interval is labeled and corresponds
to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between these events and contraction in the heart.

There are five prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. The small P wave
represents the depolarization of the atria. The atria begin contracting approximately 25 ms after the start of the P wave. The
large QRS complex represents the depolarization of the ventricles, which requires a much stronger electrical signal because
of the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle. The ventricles begin to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R
wave. Lastly, the T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles. The repolarization of the atria occurs during the
QRS complex, which masks it on an ECG.

The major segments and intervals of an ECG tracing are indicated in Figure 19.23. Segments are defined as the regions
between two waves. Intervals include one segment plus one or more waves. For example, the PR segment begins at the end
of the P wave and ends at the beginning of the QRS complex. The PR interval starts at the beginning of the P wave and
ends with the beginning of the QRS complex. The PR interval is more clinically relevant, as it measures the duration from
the beginning of atrial depolarization (the P wave) to the initiation of the QRS complex. Since the Q wave may be difficult
to view in some tracings, the measurement is often extended to the R that is more easily visible. Should there be a delay
in passage of the impulse from the SA node to the AV node, it would be visible in the PR interval. Figure 19.24 correlates
events of heart contraction to the corresponding segments and intervals of an ECG.

ECG Abnormalities

Occassionally, an area of the heart other than the SA node will initiate an impulse that will be followed by a premature
contraction. Such an area, which may actually be a component of the conduction system or some other contractile
cells, is known as an ectopic focus or ectopic pacemaker. An ectopic focus may be stimulated by localized ischemia;
exposure to certain drugs, including caffeine, digitalis, or acetylcholine; elevated stimulation by both sympathetic
or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system; or a number of disease or pathological conditions.
Occasional occurances are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the condition becomes chronic, it
may lead to either an arrhythmia, a deviation from the normal pattern of impulse conduction and contraction, or to
fibrillation, an uncoordinated beating of the heart.

While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full understanding of
the complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience. In general, the size of the electrical
variations, the duration of the events, and detailed vector analysis provide the most comprehensive picture of cardiac
function. For example, an amplified P wave may indicate enlargement of the atria, an enlarged Q wave may indicate
a MI, and an enlarged suppressed or inverted Q wave often indicates enlarged ventricles. T waves often appear flatter
when insufficient oxygen is being delivered to the myocardium. An elevation of the ST segment above baseline is
often seen in patients with an acute MI, and may appear depressed below the baseline when hypoxia is occurring.

As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations. For example, not all areas
suffering a MI may be obvious on the ECG. Additionally, it will not reveal the effectiveness of the pumping, which
requires further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging. It is also
possible for there to be pulseless electrical activity, which will show up on an ECG tracing, although there is no
corresponding pumping action. Common abnormalities that may be detected by the ECGs are shown in Figure 19.25.

External Automated Defibrillators

In the event that the electrical activity of the heart is severely disrupted, cessation of electrical activity or fibrillation
may occur. In fibrillation, the heart beats in a wild, uncontrolled manner, which prevents it from being able to pump
effectively. Atrial fibrillation (see Figure 19.25b) is a serious condition, but as long as the ventricles continue to pump
blood, the patient’s life may not be in immediate danger. Ventricular fibrillation (see Figure 19.25d) is a medical
emergency that requires life support, because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood. In a hospital setting,
it is often described as “code blue.” If untreated for as little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to
brain death. The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special paddles to apply a charge to the heart
from an external electrical source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm (Figure 19.26). A defibrillator
effectively stops the heart so that the SA node can trigger a normal conduction cycle. Because of their effectiveness
in reestablishing a normal sinus rhythm, external automated defibrillators (EADs) are being placed in areas frequented
by large numbers of people, such as schools, restaurants, and airports. These devices contain simple and direct verbal
instructions that can be followed by nonmedical personnel in an attempt to save a life.

A heart block refers to an interruption in the normal conduction pathway. The nomenclature for these is very
straightforward. SA nodal blocks occur within the SA node. AV nodal blocks occur within the AV node. Infra-Hisian blocks
involve the bundle of His. Bundle branch blocks occur within either the left or right atrioventricular bundle branches.
Hemiblocks are partial and occur within one or more fascicles of the atrioventricular bundle branch. Clinically, the most
common types are the AV nodal and infra-Hisian blocks.

AV blocks are often described by degrees. A first-degree or partial block indicates a delay in conduction between the
SA and AV nodes. This can be recognized on the ECG as an abnormally long PR interval. A second-degree or incomplete
block occurs when some impulses from the SA node reach the AV node and continue, while others do not. In this instance,
the ECG would reveal some P waves not followed by a QRS complex, while others would appear normal. In the third-
degree or complete block, there is no correlation between atrial activity (the P wave) and ventricular activity (the QRS
complex). Even in the event of a total SA block, the AV node will assume the role of pacemaker and continue initiating
contractions at 40-60 contractions per minute, which is adequate to maintain consciousness. Second- and third-degree
blocks are demonstrated on the ECG presented in Figure 19.25.

When arrhythmias become a chronic problem, the heart maintains a junctional rhythm, which originates in the
AV node. In order to speed up the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant an artificial
pacemaker, which delivers electrical impulses to the heart muscle to ensure that the heart continues to contract and pump
blood effectively. These artificial pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide stimulation
temporarily upon demand or on a continuous basis. Some devices also contain built-in defibrillators.

Cardiac Muscle Metabolism

Normally, cardiac muscle metabolism is entirely aerobic. Oxygen from the lungs is brought to the heart, and every
other organ, attached to the hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocytes. Heart cells also store appreciable amounts of
oxygen in myoglobin. Normally, these two mechanisms, circulating oxygen and oxygen attached to myoglobin, can supply
sufficient oxygen to the heart, even during peak performance.

812 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Fatty acids and glucose from the circulation are broken down within the mitochondria to release energy in the form of
ATP. Both fatty acid droplets and glycogen are stored within the sarcoplasm and provide additional nutrient supply. (Seek
additional content for more detail about metabolism.)

19.3 | Cardiac Cycle

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the relationship between blood pressure and blood flow
¢ Summarize the events of the cardiac cycle
* Compare atrial and ventricular systole and diastole
¢ Relate heart sounds detected by auscultation to action of heart’s valves

The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac
cycle (Figure 19.27). The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called
systole. The period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole. Both the atria and ventricles
undergo systole and diastole, and it is essential that these components be carefully regulated and coordinated to ensure blood
is pumped efficiently to the body.

Figure 19.27 Overview of the Cardiac Cycle The cardiac cycle begins with atrial systole and progresses to
ventricular systole, atrial diastole, and ventricular diastole, when the cycle begins again. Correlations to the ECG are
highlighted.

Pressures and Flow

Fluids, whether gases or liquids, are materials that flow according to pressure gradients—that is, they move from regions
that are higher in pressure to regions that are lower in pressure. Accordingly, when the heart chambers are relaxed (diastole),
blood will flow into the atria from the veins, which are higher in pressure. As blood flows into the atria, the pressure will
rise, so the blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles. When the action potential triggers the
muscles in the atria to contract (atrial systole), the pressure within the atria rises further, pumping blood into the ventricles.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 813

During ventricular systole, pressure rises in the ventricles, pumping blood into the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle
and into the aorta from the left ventricle. Again, as you consider this flow and relate it to the conduction pathway, the
elegance of the system should become apparent.

Phases of the Cardiac Cycle

At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). Blood is flowing into the right
atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Blood flows into the left atrium from the four
pulmonary veins. The two atrioventricular valves, the tricuspid and mitral valves, are both open, so blood flows unimpeded
from the atria and into the ventricles. Approximately 70-80 percent of ventricular filling occurs by this method. The two
semilunar valves, the pulmonary and aortic valves, are closed, preventing backflow of blood into the right and left ventricles
from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left.

Atrial Systole and Diastole

Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As the atrial muscles contract from
the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped
into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular (tricuspid, and mitral or bicuspid) valves. At the start of atrial systole,
the ventricles are normally filled with approximately 70-80 percent of their capacity due to inflow during diastole. Atrial
contraction, also referred to as the “atrial kick,” contributes the remaining 20-30 percent of filling (see Figure 19.27). Atrial
systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole.

Ventricular Systole

Ventricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex
in the ECG. It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial systole and just
prior to atrial contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult in a standing position. This
volume is known as the end diastolic volume (EDV) or preload.

Initially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet
high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. However, blood pressure
quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. This increase in pressure causes blood to flow back
toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early
stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is
known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure 19.27).

In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle
has raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk and the
aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure generated by the
left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the
aorta will be so much higher. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood. This quantity is referred to as
stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70-80 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV
of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50-60 mL of blood remaining in the ventricle following
contraction. This volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume (ESV).

Ventricular Diastole

Ventricular relaxation, or diastole, follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the T wave of the ECG. It
too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms.

During the early phase of ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the remaining blood within
the ventricle begins to fall. When pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both the pulmonary trunk and aorta,
blood flows back toward the heart, producing the dicrotic notch (small dip) seen in blood pressure tracings. The semilunar
valves close to prevent backflow into the heart. Since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point, there is no
change in the volume of blood in the ventricle, so the early phase of ventricular diastole is called the isovolumic ventricular
relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase (see Figure 19.27).

In the second phase of ventricular diastole, called late ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure
on the blood within the ventricles drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria. When this occurs,
blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves. As pressure drops within the
ventricles, blood flows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the ventricles. Both chambers are in
diastole, the atrioventricular valves are open, and the semilunar valves remain closed (see Figure 19.27). The cardiac cycle
is complete.

Figure 19.28 illustrates the relationship between the cardiac cycle and the ECG.

Figure 19.28 Relationship between the Cardiac Cycle and ECG Initially, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed
(diastole). The P wave represents depolarization of the atria and is followed by atrial contraction (systole). Atrial systole
extends until the QRS complex, at which point, the atria relax. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the
ventricles and is followed by ventricular contraction. The T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles and
marks the beginning of ventricular relaxation.

Heart Sounds

One of the simplest, yet effective, diagnostic techniques applied to assess the state of a patient’s heart is auscultation using
a stethoscope.

In a normal, healthy heart, there are only two audible heart sounds: S; and S2. Sj is the sound created by the closing
of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as a “lub,” or first heart sound. The
second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves during ventricular diastole and is described as
a “dub” (Figure 19.29). In both cases, as the valves close, the openings within the atrioventricular septum guarded by the
valves will become reduced, and blood flow through the opening will become more turbulent until the valves are fully
closed. There is a third heart sound, S3, but it is rarely heard in healthy individuals. It may be the sound of blood flowing
into the atria, or blood sloshing back and forth in the ventricle, or even tensing of the chordae tendineae. S3 may be heard
in youth, some athletes, and pregnant women. If the sound is heard later in life, it may indicate congestive heart failure,
warranting further tests. Some cardiologists refer to the collective Si, S2, and S3 sounds as the “Kentucky gallop,” because
they mimic those produced by a galloping horse. The fourth heart sound, S4, results from the contraction of the atria pushing
blood into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle, indicating failure of the left ventricle. S4 occurs prior to S and the collective
sounds Sq, S1, and S2 are referred to by some cardiologists as the “Tennessee gallop,” because of their similarity to the
sound produced by a galloping horse with a different gait. A few individuals may have both S3 and Sq, and this combined
sound is referred to as S7.

heart sounds. The y-axis represents pressure.

The term murmur is used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the turbulent flow of
blood. Murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the most common, the most difficult sound to detect, and the
least serious. The most severe is a 6. Phonocardiograms or auscultograms can be used to record both normal and abnormal
sounds using specialized electronic stethoscopes.

During auscultation, it is common practice for the clinician to ask the patient to breathe deeply. This procedure not
only allows for listening to airflow, but it may also amplify heart murmurs. Inhalation increases blood flow into the right
side of the heart and may increase the amplitude of right-sided heart murmurs. Expiration partially restricts blood flow into
the left side of the heart and may amplify left-sided heart murmurs. Figure 19.30 indicates proper placement of the bell of
the stethoscope to facilitate auscultation.

19.4 | Cardiac Physiology

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Relate heart rate to cardiac output
* Describe the effect of exercise on heart rate
¢ Identify cardiovascular centers and cardiac reflexes that regulate heart function
¢ Describe factors affecting heart rate
¢ Distinguish between positive and negative factors that affect heart contractility
¢ Summarize factors affecting stroke volume and cardiac output
¢ Describe the cardiac response to variations in blood flow and pressure

The autorhythmicity inherent in cardiac cells keeps the heart beating at a regular pace; however, the heart is regulated by
and responds to outside influences as well. Neural and endocrine controls are vital to the regulation of cardiac function. In
addition, the heart is sensitive to several environmental factors, including electrolytes.

Resting Cardiac Output

Cardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute. To calculate this
value, multiply stroke volume (SV), the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle, by heart rate (HR), in contractions
per minute (or beats per minute, bpm). It can be represented mathematically by the following equation:

CO =HR*x SV

SV is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record EDV and ESV, and calculating the difference: SV = EDV
— ESV. SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous
to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several
important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration
of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance. Normal range for SV would be 55-100 mL. An average resting
HR would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60-100 in some individuals.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 817

Using these numbers, the mean CO is 5.25 L/min, with a range of 4.0-8.0 L/min. Remember, however, that these
numbers refer to CO from each ventricle separately, not the total for the heart. Factors influencing CO are summarized in
Figure 19.31.

Figure 19.31 Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke
volume, both of which are also variable.

SVs are also used to calculate ejection fraction, which is the portion of the blood that is pumped or ejected from the
heart with each contraction. To calculate ejection fraction, SV is divided by EDV. Despite the name, the ejection fraction is
normally expressed as a percentage. Ejection fractions range from approximately 55-70 percent, with a mean of 58 percent.

Exercise and Maximum Cardiac Output

In healthy young individuals, HR may increase to 150 bpm during exercise. SV can also increase from 70 to approximately
130 mL due to increased strength of contraction. This would increase CO to approximately 19.5 L/min, 4-5 times the resting
rate. Top cardiovascular athletes can achieve even higher levels. At their peak performance, they may increase resting CO
by 7-8 times.

Since the heart is a muscle, exercising it increases its efficiency. The difference between maximum and resting CO is
known as the cardiac reserve. It measures the residual capacity of the heart to pump blood.

Heart Rates

HRs vary considerably, not only with exercise and fitness levels, but also with age. Newborn resting HRs may be 120 bpm.
HR gradually decreases until young adulthood and then gradually increases again with age.

Maximum HRs are normally in the range of 200-220 bpm, although there are some extreme cases in which they may
reach higher levels. As one ages, the ability to generate maximum rates decreases. This may be estimated by taking the
maximal value of 220 bpm and subtracting the individual’s age. So a 40-year-old individual would be expected to hit a
maximum rate of approximately 180, and a 60-year-old person would achieve a HR of 160.

818 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Heart: Abnormal Heart Rates

For an adult, normal resting HR will be in the range of 60-100 bpm. Bradycardia is the condition in which resting
rate drops below 60 bpm, and tachycardia is the condition in which the resting rate is above 100 bpm. Trained athletes
typically have very low HRs. If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, dizziness,
fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically significant.
However, if any of these symptoms are present, they may indicate that the heart is not providing sufficient oxygenated
blood to the tissues. The term relative bradycardia may be used with a patient who has a HR in the normal range but is
still suffering from these symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic as long as the HR remains above 50 bpm.

Bradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the heart. While the condition may
be inherited, typically it is acquired in older individuals. Inherent causes include abnormalities in either the SA or AV
node. If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required. Other causes include ischemia to the heart muscle
or diseases of the heart vessels or valves. External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of the endocrine
system often involving the thyroid, electrolyte imbalances, neurological disorders including inappropriate autonomic
responses, autoimmune pathologies, over-prescription of beta blocker drugs that reduce HR, recreational drug use, or
even prolonged bed rest. Treatment relies upon establishing the underlying cause of the disorder and may necessitate
supplemental oxygen.

Tachycardia is not normal in a resting patient but may be detected in pregnant women or individuals experiencing
extreme stress. In the latter case, it would likely be triggered by stimulation from the limbic system or disorders of
the autonomic nervous system. In some cases, tachycardia may involve only the atria. Some individuals may remain
asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms may include dizziness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, rapid pulse,
heart palpations, chest pain, or fainting (syncope). While tachycardia is defined as a HR above 100 bpm, there is
considerable variation among people. Further, the normal resting HRs of children are often above 100 bpm, but
this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be benign, but the condition may also be
correlated with fever, anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, hypersecretion of catecholamines, some cardiomyopathies,
some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation. Elevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are
normal and expected. Resting rate should always be taken after recovery from exercise. Treatment depends upon the
underlying cause but may include medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ablation, or surgery.

Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output

Initially, physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV. During exercise, the rate of blood
returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time
or the ventricles to fill with blood. Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially remain high. However, as HR
continues to increase, SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time. CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR
compensates for the decreasing SV, but at very high rates, CO will eventually decrease as increasing rates are no longer able
to compensate for the decreasing SV. Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual. Initially, as HR increases
rom resting to approximately 120 bpm, CO will rise. As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the
increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and, consequently, SV. As HR continues to rise above 160
bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases. So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the
health of the heart, individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of
between 120 and 160 bpm, so CO is maintained. The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and
lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age.

Cardiovascular Centers

ervous control over HR is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata (Figure
19.32). The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and
the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve,
cranial nerve X. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is
a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node
would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.

Both sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulations flow through a paired complex network of nerve fibers known
as the cardiac plexus near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the
cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1—T4) to both the SA and AV
nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers
than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) at the
neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. NE shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization

and contraction, which results in an increase in HR. It opens chemical- or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels,
allowing an influx of positively charged ions.

NE binds to the beta-1 receptor. Some cardiac medications (for example, beta blockers) work by blocking these
receptors, thereby slowing HR and are one possible treatment for hypertension. Overprescription of these drugs may lead to
bradycardia and even stoppage of the heart.

Figure 19.32 Autonomic Innervation of the Heart Cardioaccelerator and cardioinhibitory areas are components
of the paired cardiac centers located in the medulla oblongata of the brain. They innervate the heart via sympathetic
cardiac nerves that increase cardiac activity and vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that slow cardiac activity.

Parasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve
(cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and
ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction.
ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization,
which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous
stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less
than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving
a car with one foot on the brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one’s foot from the break and let the engine
increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows
HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation. Figure
19.33 illustrates the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation on the normal sinus rhythm.

Following sympathetic stimulation, HR increases.

Input to the Cardiovascular Center

The cardiovascular center receives input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory
‘ibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors,
baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system. Collectively, these inputs normally enable the
cardiovascular centers to regulate heart function precisely, a process known as cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity
results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. Any such
increase in physical activity would logically warrant increased blood flow. The cardiac centers monitor these increased rates
of firing, and suppress parasympathetic stimulation and increase sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase
blood flow.
Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other
locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors
represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor
baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure
and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase
parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac
centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.

There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to
the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as
the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center
responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR. The opposite is
also true.

CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART 821

Increased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic
acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus
nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for increased or decreased
blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.

The limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not unusual
to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing
extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically
transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR
effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety
and HR.

Heart: Broken Heart Syndrome

Extreme stress from such life events as the death of a loved one, an emotional break up, loss of income, or foreclosure
of a home may lead to a condition commonly referred to as broken heart syndrome. This condition may also be called
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, transient apical ballooning syndrome, apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, stress-induced
cardiomyopathy, Gebrochenes-Herz syndrome, and stress cardiomyopathy. The recognized effects on the heart include
congestive heart failure due to a profound weakening of the myocardium not related to lack of oxygen. This may lead
to acute heart failure, lethal arrhythmias, or even the rupture of a ventricle. The exact etiology is not known, but several
factors have been suggested, including transient vasospasm, dysfunction of the cardiac capillaries, or thickening of the
myocardium—particularly in the left ventricle—that may lead to the critical circulation of blood to this region. While
many patients survive the initial acute event with treatment to restore normal function, there is a strong correlation with
death. Careful statistical analysis by the Cass Business School, a prestigious institution located in London, published
in 2008, revealed that within one year of the death of a loved one, women are more than twice as likely to die and
males are six times as likely to die as would otherwise be expected.

Other Factors Influencing Heart Rate

Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise
control over HR. However, there are a number of other factors that have an impact on HR as well, including epinephrine,
NE, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia;
and pH balance (Table 19.1 and Table 19.2). After reading this section, the importance of maintaining homeostasis should
become even more apparent.

Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

The catecholamines, epinephrine and NE, secreted by the adrenal medulla form one component of the extended fight-or-
flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to
the beta-1 receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization
is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period
of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may
actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.

Thyroid Hormones

In general, increased levels of thyroid hormone, or thyroxin, increase cardiac rate and contractility. The impact of thyroid
hormone is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines. The physiologically active form of thyroid
hormone, T3 or triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity at the level of the
genome. It also impacts the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and NE described above. Excessive levels of
thyroxin may trigger tachycardia.

Calcium

Calcium ion levels have great impacts upon both HR and contractility; as the levels of calcium ions increase, so do HR
and contractility. High levels of calcium ions (hypercalcemia) may be implicated in a short QT interval and a widened T
wave in the ECG. The QT interval represents the time from the start of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles,
and includes the period of ventricular systole. Extremely high levels of calcium may induce cardiac arrest. Drugs known as
calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the inward movement of calcium
ions.

Caffeine and Nicotine

Caffeine and nicotine are not found naturally within the body. Both of these nonregulated drugs have an excitatory effect
on membranes of neurons in general and have a stimulatory effect on the cardiac centers specifically, causing an increase in
HR. Caffeine works by increasing the rates of depolarization at the SA node, whereas nicotine stimulates the activity of the
sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.

Although it is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive drug, caffeine is legal and not regulated. While precise
quantities have not been established, “normal” consumption is not considered harmful to most people, although it may cause
disruptions to sleep and acts as a diuretic. Its consumption by pregnant women is cautioned against, although no evidence
of negative effects has been confirmed. Tolerance and even physical and mental addiction to the drug result in individuals
who routinely consume the substance.

Nicotine, too, is a stimulant and produces addiction. While legal and nonregulated, concerns about nicotine’s safety
and documented links to respiratory and cardiac disease have resulted in warning labels on cigarette packages.

Factors Decreasing Heart Rate

HR can be slowed when a person experiences altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and
hypothermia (see Table 19.1). The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance
is critical to the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially,
both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high
hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and
other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium
levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.

Heart muscle relies exclusively on aerobic metabolism for energy. Hypoxia (an insufficient supply of oxygen) leads to
decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.

Acidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value.
Alkalosis is a condition in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood
pH falls in the range of 7.35-7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents
alkalosis. Recall that enzymes are the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions; they are sensitive to
PH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying
slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex,
subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in
pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.

The last variable is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body
temperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction. Hypothermia
slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving
reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique
that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patient’s blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-
lung machine to maintain the body’s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can
be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease
normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.

Stroke Volume

Many of the same factors that regulate HR also impact cardiac function by altering SV. While a number of variables are
involved, SV is ultimately dependent upon the difference between EDV and ESV. The three primary factors to consider are
preload, or the stretch on the ventricles prior to contraction; the contractility, or the force or strength of the contraction itself;
and afterload, the force the ventricles must generate to pump blood against the resistance in the vessels. These factors are
summarized in Table 19.1 and Table 19.2.

Preload

Preload is another way of expressing EDV. Therefore, the greater the EDV is, the greater the preload is. One of the primary
factors to consider is filling time, or the duration of ventricular diastole during which filling occurs. The more rapidly the
heart contracts, the shorter the filling time becomes, and the lower the EDV and preload are. This effect can be partially
overcome by increasing the second variable, contractility, and raising SV, but over time, the heart is unable to compensate
for decreased filling time, and preload also decreases.

With increasing ventricular filling, both EDV or preload increase, and the cardiac muscle itself is stretched to a greater
degree. At rest, there is little stretch of the ventricular muscle, and the sarcomeres remain short. With increased ventricular
filling, the ventricular muscle is increasingly stretched and the sarcomere length increases. As the sarcomeres reach their
optimal lengths, they will contract more powerfully, because more of the myosin heads can bind to the actin on the thin
filaments, forming cross bridges and increasing the strength of contraction and SV. If this process were to continue and the
sarcomeres stretched beyond their optimal lengths, the force of contraction would decrease. However, due to the physical
constraints of the location of the heart, this excessive stretch is not a concern.

The relationship between ventricular stretch and contraction has been stated in the well-known Frank-Starling
mechanism or simply Starling’s Law of the Heart. This principle states that, within physiological limits, the force of heart
contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber. This means that the greater the stretch of the
ventricular muscle (within limits), the more powerful the contraction is, which in turn increases SV. Therefore, by increasing
preload, you increase the second variable, contractility.

Otto Frank (1865-1944) was a German physiologist; among his many published works are detailed studies of this
important heart relationship. Ernest Starling (1866-1927) was an important English physiologist who also studied the heart.


824 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the
name “Frank-Starling mechanism.”
Any sympathetic stimulation to the venous system will increase venous return to the heart, which contributes to
ventricular filling, and EDV and preload. While much of the ventricular filling occurs while both atria and ventricles are in
diastole, the contraction of the atria, the atrial kick, plays a crucial role by providing the last 20-30 percent of ventricular
filling.

Contractility

It is virtually impossible to consider preload or ESV without including an early mention of the concept of contractility.
Indeed, the two parameters are intimately linked. Contractility refers to the force of the contraction of the heart muscle,
which controls SV, and is the primary parameter for impacting ESV. The more forceful the contraction is, the greater the SV
and smaller the ESV are. Less forceful contractions result in smaller SVs and larger ESVs. Factors that increase contractility
are described as positive inotropic factors, and those that decrease contractility are described as negative inotropic factors
(ino- = “fiber;” -tropic = “turning toward”).

Not surprisingly, sympathetic stimulation is a positive inotrope, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is a negative
inotrope. Sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of NE at the neuromuscular junction from the cardiac nerves and
also stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete epinephrine and NE. In addition to their stimulatory effects on HR, they also
bind to both alpha and beta receptors on the cardiac muscle cell membrane to increase metabolic rate and the force of
contraction. This combination of actions has the net effect of increasing SV and leaving a smaller residual ESV in the
ventricles. In comparison, parasympathetic stimulation releases ACh at the neuromuscular junction from the vagus nerve.
The membrane hyperpolarizes and inhibits contraction to decrease the strength of contraction and SV, and to raise ESV.
Since parasympathetic fibers are more widespread in the atria than in the ventricles, the primary site of action is in the upper
chambers. Parasympathetic stimulation in the atria decreases the atrial kick and reduces EDV, which decreases ventricular
stretch and preload, thereby further limiting the force of ventricular contraction. Stronger parasympathetic stimulation also
directly decreases the force of contraction of the ventricles.

Several synthetic drugs, including dopamine and isoproterenol, have been developed that mimic the effects of
epinephrine and NE by stimulating the influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid. Higher concentrations of
intracellular calcium ions increase the strength of contraction. Excess calcium (hypercalcemia) also acts as a positive
inotropic agent. The drug digitalis lowers HR and increases the strength of the contraction, acting as a positive inotropic
agent by blocking the sequestering of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to higher intracellular
calcium levels and greater strength of contraction. In addition to the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, other
hormones also demonstrate positive inotropic effects. These include thyroid hormones and glucagon from the pancreas.

Negative inotropic agents include hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a variety of synthetic drugs. These include
numerous beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Early beta blocker drugs include propranolol and pronethalol, and
are credited with revolutionizing treatment of cardiac patients experiencing angina pectoris. There is also a large class of
dihydropyridine, phenylalkylamine, and benzothiazepine calcium channel blockers that may be administered decreasing the
strength of contraction and SV.

Afterload

Afterload refers to the tension that the ventricles must develop to pump blood effectively against the resistance in the
vascular system. Any condition that increases resistance requires a greater afterload to force open the semilunar valves and
pump the blood. Damage to the valves, such as stenosis, which makes them harder to open will also increase afterload. Any
decrease in resistance decreases the afterload. Figure 19.34 summarizes the major factors influencing SV, Figure 19.35
summarizes the major factors influencing CO, and Table 19.3 and Table 19.4 summarize cardiac responses to increased
and decreased blood flow and pressure in order to restore homeostasis.

19.5 | Development of the Heart

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

¢ Describe the embryological development of heart structures

* Identify five regions of the fetal heart
¢ Relate fetal heart structures to adult counterparts

The human heart is the first functional organ to develop. It begins beating and pumping blood around day 21 or 22, a mere
three weeks after fertilization. This emphasizes the critical nature of the heart in distributing blood through the vessels and
the vital exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and wastes both to and from the developing baby. The critical early development of
the heart is reflected by the prominent heart bulge that appears on the anterior surface of the embryo.

The heart forms from an embryonic tissue called mesoderm around 18 to 19 days after fertilization. Mesoderm is one
of the three primary germ layers that differentiates early in development that collectively gives rise to all subsequent tissues
and organs. The heart begins to develop near the head of the embryo in a region known as the cardiogenic area. Following
chemical signals called factors from the underlying endoderm (another of the three primary germ layers), the cardiogenic
area begins to form two strands called the cardiogenic cords (Figure 19.36). As the cardiogenic cords develop, a lumen
rapidly develops within them. At this point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes. The two tubes migrate together and
fuse to form a single primitive heart tube. The primitive heart tube quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail,
these include the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all

venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to
the truncus arteriosus. This is a very different pattern from that of an adult.

Figure 19.36 Development of the Human Heart This diagram outlines the embryological development of the human
heart during the first eight weeks and the subsequent formation of the four heart chambers.

The five regions of the primitive heart tube develop into recognizable structures in a fully developed heart. The truncus
arteriosus will eventually divide and give rise to the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The bulbus cordis develops into
the right ventricle. The primitive ventricle forms the left ventricle. The primitive atrium becomes the anterior portions of
both the right and left atria, and the two auricles. The sinus venosus develops into the posterior portion of the right atrium,
the SA node, and the coronary sinus.

As the primitive heart tube elongates, it begins to fold within the pericardium, eventually forming an S shape, which
places the chambers and major vessels into an alignment similar to the adult heart. This process occurs between days 23 and
28. The remainder of the heart development pattern includes development of septa and valves, and remodeling of the actual
chambers. Partitioning of the atria and ventricles by the interatrial septum, interventricular septum, and atrioventricular
septum is complete by the end of the fifth week, although the fetal blood shunts remain until birth or shortly after. The
atrioventricular valves form between weeks five and eight, and the semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine.

CHAPTER REVIEW

19.1 Heart Anatomy

The heart resides within the pericardial sac and is located in the mediastinal space within the thoracic cavity. The pericardial
sac consists of two fused layers: an outer fibrous capsule and an inner parietal pericardium lined with a serous membrane.
Between the pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial cavity, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid. The walls of
the heart are composed of an outer epicardium, a thick myocardium, and an inner lining layer of endocardium. The human
heart consists of a pair of atria, which receive blood and pump it into a pair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels.
The right atrium receives systemic blood relatively low in oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle, which pumps it into
the pulmonary circuit. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the lungs, and blood high in oxygen returns to the
left atrium, which pumps blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps blood into the aorta and the remainder of the
systemic circuit. The septa are the partitions that separate the chambers of the heart. They include the interatrial septum, the
interventricular septum, and the atrioventricular septum. Two of these openings are guarded by the atrioventricular valves,
the right tricuspid valve and the left mitral valve, which prevent the backflow of blood. Each is attached to chordae tendineae
that extend to the papillary muscles, which are extensions of the myocardium, to prevent the valves from being blown back
into the atria. The pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pulmonary trunk, and the left semilunar valve is located
at the base of the aorta. The right and left coronary arteries are the first to branch off the aorta and arise from two of the
three sinuses located near the base of the aorta and are generally located in the sulci. Cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac
arteries and generally drain into the coronary sinus.

19.2 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity

The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine control, yet it is capable of initiating its own action potential followed by
muscular contraction. The conductive cells within the heart establish the heart rate and transmit it through the myocardium.
The contractile cells contract and propel the blood. The normal path of transmission for the conductive cells is the sinoatrial

(SA) node, internodal pathways, atrioventricular (AV) node, atrioventricular (AV) bundle of His, bundle branches, and
+

Purkinje fibers. The action potential for the conductive cells consists of a prepotential phase with a slow influx of Na

followed by a rapid influx of Ca** and outflux of K*. Contractile cells have an action potential with an extended plateau
phase that results in an extended refractory period to allow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood effectively.
Recognizable points on the ECG include the P wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization, the QRS complex that
corresponds to ventricular depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to ventricular repolarization.

19.3 Cardiac Cycle

The cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and contraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts approximately
0.8 seconds. Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the veins into the atria and past the
atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. The atria begin to contract (atrial systole), following depolarization of the atria,
and pump blood into the ventricles. The ventricles begin to contract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within the
ventricles. When ventricular pressure rises above the pressure in the atria, blood flows toward the atria, producing the first
heart sound, S or lub. As pressure in the ventricles rises above two major arteries, blood pushes open the two semilunar
valves and moves into the pulmonary trunk and aorta in the ventricular ejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization,
the ventricles begin to relax (ventricular diastole), and pressure within the ventricles drops. As ventricular pressure drops,
there is a tendency for blood to flow back into the atria from the major arteries, producing the dicrotic notch in the ECG and
closing the two semilunar valves. The second heart sound, S2 or dub, occurs when the semilunar valves close. When the
pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from the atria into the ventricles, opening the atrioventricular valves and
marking one complete heart cycle. The valves prevent backflow of blood. Failure of the valves to operate properly produces
turbulent blood flow within the heart; the resulting heart murmur can often be heard with a stethoscope.

19.4 Cardiac Physiology

Many factors affect HR and SV, and together, they contribute to cardiac function. HR is largely determined and regulated
by autonomic stimulation and hormones. There are several feedback loops that contribute to maintaining homeostasis
dependent upon activity levels, such as the atrial reflex, which is determined by venous return.

834 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART

SV is regulated by autonomic innervation and hormones, but also by filling time and venous return. Venous return
is determined by activity of the skeletal muscles, blood volume, and changes in peripheral circulation. Venous return
determines preload and the atrial reflex. Filling time directly related to HR also determines preload. Preload then impacts
both EDV and ESV. Autonomic innervation and hormones largely regulate contractility. Contractility impacts EDV as does
afterload. CO is the product of HR multiplied by SV. SV is the difference between EDV and ESV.

19.5 Development of the Heart

The heart is the first organ to form and become

‘unctional, emphasizing the importance of transport of material to and from

the developing infant. It originates about day 18 or 19 from the mesoderm and begins beating and pumping blood about
day 21 or 22. It forms from the cardiogenic region near the head and is visible as a prominent heart bulge on the surface

of the embryo. Originally, it consists of a pair o

strands called cardiogenic cords that quickly form a hollow lumen and are

referred to as endocardial tubes. These then fuse into a single heart tube and differentiate into the truncus arteriosus, bulbus
cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and sinus venosus, starting about day 22. The primitive heart begins to form an
S shape within the pericardium between days 23 and 28. The internal septa begin to form about day 28, separating the heart
into the atria and ventricles, although the foramen ovale persists until shortly after birth. Between weeks five and eight, the
atrioventricular valves form. The semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine.

superficial veins of the upper limb provide an indication of the extent, prominence, and importance of these structures
to the body. (credit: Colin Davis)

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Compare and contrast the anatomical structure of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins

838 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

* Accurately describe the forces that account for capillary exchange

* List the major factors affecting blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance

* Describe how blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance interrelate

* Describe the interaction of the cardiovascular system with other body systems

* Label the major blood vessels of the pulmonary and systemic circulations

* Identify and describe the hepatic portal system

* Describe the development of blood vessels and fetal circulation

* Compare fetal circulation to that of an individual after birth

In this chapter, you will learn about the vascular part of the cardiovascular system, that is, the vessels that transport blood
throughout the body and provide the physical site where gases, nutrients, and other substances are exchanged with body
cells. When vessel functioning is reduced, blood-borne substances do not circulate effectively throughout the body. As a
result, tissue injury occurs, metabolism is impaired, and the functions of every bodily system are threatened.

20.1 | Structure and Function of Blood Vessels

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Compare and contrast the three tunics that make up the walls of most blood vessels
¢ Distinguish between elastic arteries, muscular arteries, and arterioles on the basis of structure, location, and function
¢ Describe the basic structure of a capillary bed, from the supplying metarteriole to the venule into which it drains

¢ Explain the structure and function of venous valves in the large veins of the extremities

Blood is carried through the body via blood vessels. An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart,
where it branches into ever-smaller vessels. Eventually, the smallest arteries, vessels called arterioles, further branch into
tiny capillaries, where nutrients and wastes are exchanged, and then combine with other vessels that exit capillaries to form
venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a vein, a larger blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.

Arteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits: the systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit (Figure 20.2).
Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the body’s tissues. The blood returned to the heart through systemic
veins has less oxygen, since much of the oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells. In contrast, in the
pulmonary circuit, arteries carry blood low in oxygen exclusively to the lungs for gas exchange. Pulmonary veins then return
freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart to be pumped back out into systemic circulation. Although arteries and
veins differ structurally and functionally, they share certain features.

Figure 20.2 Cardiovascular Circulation The pulmonary circuit moves blood from the right side of the heart to the
lungs and back to the heart. The systemic circuit moves blood from the left side of the heart to the head and body and
returns it to the right side of the heart to repeat the cycle. The arrows indicate the direction of blood flow, and the colors
show the relative levels of oxygen concentration.

Shared Structures

Different types of blood vessels vary slightly in their structures, but they share the same general features. Arteries and
arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and receive blood that is surging at
a far greater pressure (Figure 20.3). Each type of vessel has a lumen—a hollow passageway through which blood flows.
Arteries have smaller lumens than veins, a characteristic that helps to maintain the pressure of blood moving through the
system. Together, their thicker walls and smaller diameters give arterial lumens a more rounded appearance in cross section
than the lumens of veins.

Figure 20.3 Structure of Blood Vessels (a) Arteries and (b) veins share the same general features, but the walls of
arteries are much thicker because of the higher pressure of the blood that flows through them. (c) A micrograph shows
the relative differences in thickness. LM x 160. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan
Medical School © 2012)

By the time blood has passed through capillaries and entered venules, the pressure initially exerted upon it by heart
contractions has diminished. In other words, in comparison to arteries, venules and veins withstand a much lower pressure
from the blood that flows through them. Their walls are considerably thinner and their lumens are correspondingly larger
in diameter, allowing more blood to flow with less vessel resistance. In addition, many veins of the body, particularly those
of the limbs, contain valves that assist the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart. This is critical because blood flow
becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower pressure and the effects of gravity.

The walls of arteries and veins are largely composed of living cells and their products (including collagenous and
elastic fibers); the cells require nourishment and produce waste. Since blood passes through the larger vessels relatively
quickly, there is limited opportunity for blood in the lumen of the vessel to provide nourishment to or remove waste from the
vessel’s cells. Further, the walls of the larger vessels are too thick for nutrients to diffuse through to all of the cells. Larger
arteries and veins contain small blood vessels within their walls known as the vasa vasorum—literally “vessels of the
vessel”—to provide them with this critical exchange. Since the pressure within arteries is relatively high, the vasa vasorum
must function in the outer layers of the vessel (see Figure 20.3) or the pressure exerted by the blood passing through the
vessel would collapse it, preventing any exchange from occurring. The lower pressure within veins allows the vasa vasorum
to be located closer to the lumen. The restriction of the vasa vasorum to the outer layers of arteries is thought to be one
reason that arterial diseases are more common than venous diseases, since its location makes it more difficult to nourish the
cells of the arteries and remove waste products. There are also minute nerves within the walls of both types of vessels that
control the contraction and dilation of smooth muscle. These minute nerves are known as the nervi vasorum.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 841

Both arteries and veins have the same three distinct tissue layers, called tunics (from the Latin term tunica), for the
garments first worn by ancient Romans; the term tunic is also used for some modern garments. From the most interior
layer to the outer, these tunics are the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (see Figure 20.3). Table 20.1
compares and contrasts the tunics of the arteries and veins.

Tunica Intima

The tunica intima (also called the tunica interna) is composed of epithelial and connective tissue layers. Lining the tunica
intima is the specialized simple squamous epithelium called the endothelium, which is continuous throughout the entire
vascular system, including the lining of the chambers of the heart. Damage to this endothelial lining and exposure of blood
to the collagenous fibers beneath is one of the primary causes of clot formation. Until recently, the endothelium was viewed
simply as the boundary between the blood in the lumen and the walls of the vessels. Recent studies, however, have shown
that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping to regulate capillary exchange and altering blood flow. The
endothelium releases local chemicals called endothelins that can constrict the smooth muscle within the walls of the vessel
to increase blood pressure. Uncompensated overproduction of endothelins may contribute to hypertension (high blood
pressure) and cardiovascular disease.
ext to the endothelium is the basement membrane, or basal lamina, that effectively binds the endothelium to the
connective tissue. The basement membrane provides strength while maintaining flexibility, and it is permeable, allowing
materials to pass through it. The thin outer layer of the tunica intima contains a small amount of areolar connective tissue
that consists primarily of elastic fibers to provide the vessel with additional flexibility; it also contains some collagenous
fibers to provide additional strength.
n larger arteries, there is also a thick, distinct layer of elastic fibers known as the internal elastic membrane (also
called the internal elastic lamina) at the boundary with the tunica media. Like the other components of the tunica intima, the
internal elastic membrane provides structure while allowing the vessel to stretch. It is permeated with small openings that
allow exchange of materials between the tunics. The internal elastic membrane is not apparent in veins. In addition, many
veins, particularly in the lower limbs, contain valves formed by sections of thickened endothelium that are reinforced with
connective tissue, extending into the lumen.

Under the microscope, the lumen and the entire tunica intima of a vein will appear smooth, whereas those of an artery
will normally appear wavy because of the partial constriction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media, the next layer of
blood vessel walls.


842 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Tunica Media

The tunica media is the substantial middle layer of the vessel wall (see Figure 20.3). It is generally the thickest layer in
arteries, and it is much thicker in arteries than it is in veins. The tunica media consists of layers of smooth muscle supported
by connective tissue that is primarily made up of elastic fibers, most of which are arranged in circular sheets. Toward the
outer portion of the tunic, there are also layers of longitudinal muscle. Contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles
decrease and increase the diameter of the vessel lumen, respectively. Specifically in arteries, vasoconstriction decreases
blood flow as the smooth muscle in the walls of the tunica media contracts, making the lumen narrower and increasing blood
pressure. Similarly, vasodilation increases blood flow as the smooth muscle relaxes, allowing the lumen to widen and blood
pressure to drop. Both vasoconstriction and vasodilation are regulated in part by small vascular nerves, known as nervi
vasorum, or “nerves of the vessel,” that run within the walls of blood vessels. These are generally all sympathetic fibers,
although some trigger vasodilation and others induce vasoconstriction, depending upon the nature of the neurotransmitter
and receptors located on the target cell. Parasympathetic stimulation does trigger vasodilation as well as erection during
sexual arousal in the external genitalia of both sexes. Nervous control over vessels tends to be more generalized than the
specific targeting of individual blood vessels. Local controls, discussed later, account for this phenomenon. (Seek additional
content for more information on these dynamic aspects of the autonomic nervous system.) Hormones and local chemicals
also control blood vessels. Together, these neural and chemical mechanisms reduce or increase blood flow in response to
changing body conditions, from exercise to hydration. Regulation of both blood flow and blood pressure is discussed in
detail later in this chapter.

The smooth muscle layers of the tunica media are supported by a framework of collagenous fibers that also binds the
tunica media to the inner and outer tunics. Along with the collagenous fibers are large numbers of elastic fibers that appear
as wavy lines in prepared slides. Separating the tunica media from the outer tunica externa in larger arteries is the external
elastic membrane (also called the external elastic lamina), which also appears wavy in slides. This structure is not usually
seen in smaller arteries, nor is it seen in veins.

Tunica Externa

The outer tunic, the tunica externa (also called the tunica adventitia), is a substantial sheath of connective tissue composed
primarily of collagenous fibers. Some bands of elastic fibers are found here as well. The tunica externa in veins also contains

groups of smoot
some larger arter’

h muscle fibers. This is normally the thickest tunic in veins and may be thicker than the tunica media in
ies. The outer layers of the tunica externa are not distinct but rather blend with the surrounding connective

tissue outside the vessel, helping to hold the vessel in relative position. If you are able to palpate some of the superficial

veins on your up
not hold the vess:

per limbs and try to move them, you will find that the tunica externa prevents this. If the tunica externa did
el in place, any movement would likely result in disruption of blood flow.

Arteries

An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can
withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls,
containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This type of artery is known as an elastic artery
(Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to
expand, as blood pumped from the ventricles passes through them, and then to recoil after the surge has passed. If artery
walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil, their resistance to blood flow would greatly increase and blood pressure
would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump harder to increase the volume of blood
expelled by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure and flow. Artery walls would have to become
even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure
gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system. An elastic artery is also known as a conducting artery, because the
large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.

for elastic and muscular arteries.

Farther from the heart, where the surge of blood has dampened, the percentage of elastic fibers in an artery’s tunica
intima decreases and the amount of smooth muscle in its tunica media increases. The artery at this point is described as

a muscular artery. The diameter of muscular arteries typically ranges from 0.1 mm to 10 mm. Their thick tunica media
allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in vasoconstriction. In contrast, their decreased quantity of elastic fibers
limits their ability to expand. Fortunately, because the blood pressure has eased by the time it reaches these more distant
vessels, elasticity has become less important.

Notice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular arteries are important, there is no “line of
demarcation” where an elastic artery suddenly becomes muscular. Rather, there is a gradual transition as the vascular tree
repeatedly branches. In turn, muscular arteries branch to distribute blood to the vast network of arterioles. For this reason, a
muscular artery is also known as a distributing artery.

Arterioles

An arteriole is a very small artery that leads to a capillary. Arterioles have the same three tunics as the larger vessels, but
the thickness of each is greatly diminished. The critical endothelial lining of the tunica intima is intact. The tunica media
is restricted to one or two smooth muscle cell layers in thickness. The tunica externa remains but is very thin (see Figure
20.4).

With a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles are critical in slowing down—or
resisting—blood flow and, thus, causing a substantial drop in blood pressure. Because of this, you may see them referred
to as resistance vessels. The muscle fibers in arterioles are normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles to maintain a
consistent muscle tone—in this case referred to as vascular tone—in a similar manner to the muscular tone of skeletal
muscle. In reality, all blood vessels exhibit vascular tone due to the partial contraction of smooth muscle. The importance of
the arterioles is that they will be the primary site of both resistance and regulation of blood pressure. The precise diameter
of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is determined by neural and chemical controls, and vasoconstriction and
vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for distribution of blood flow.

Capillaries

A capillary is a microscopic channel that supplies blood to the tissues themselves, a process called perfusion. Exchange
of gases and other substances occurs in the capillaries between the blood and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid
(interstitial fluid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5-10 micrometers; the smallest are just barely wide
enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow through capillaries is often described as microcirculation.

The wall of a capillary consists of the endothelial layer surrounded by a basement membrane with occasional smooth
muscle fibers. There is some variation in wall structure: In a large capillary, several endothelial cells bordering each other
may line the lumen; in a small capillary, there may be only a single cell layer that wraps around to contact itself.

For capillaries to function, their walls must be leaky, allowing substances to pass through. There are three major types
of capillaries, which differ according to their degree of “leakiness:” continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoid capillaries (Figure
20.5).

Continuous Capillaries

The most common type of capillary, the continuous capillary, is found in almost all vascularized tissues. Continuous
capillaries are characterized by a complete endothelial lining with tight junctions between endothelial cells. Although a tight
junction is usually impermeable and only allows for the passage of water and ions, they are often incomplete in capillaries,
leaving intercellular clefts that allow for exchange of water and other very small molecules between the blood plasma and
the interstitial fluid. Substances that can pass between cells include metabolic products, such as glucose, water, and small
hydrophobic molecules like gases and hormones, as well as various leukocytes. Continuous capillaries not associated with
the brain are rich in transport vesicles, contributing to either endocytosis or exocytosis. Those in the brain are part of the
blood-brain barrier. Here, there are tight junctions and no intercellular clefts, plus a thick basement membrane and astrocyte
extensions called end feet; these structures combine to prevent the movement of nearly all substances.

844 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Fenestrated Capillaries

A fenestrated capillary is one that has pores (or fenestrations) in addition to tight junctions in the endothelial lining.
These make the capillary permeable to larger molecules. The number of fenestrations and their degree of permeability vary,
however, according to their location. Fenestrated capillaries are common in the small intestine, which is the primary site of
nutrient absorption, as well as in the kidneys, which filter the blood. They are also found in the choroid plexus of the brain
and many endocrine structures, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, and thyroid glands.

Sinusoid Capillaries

A sinusoid capillary (or sinusoid) is the least common type of capillary. Sinusoid capillaries are flattened, and they
have extensive intercellular gaps and incomplete basement membranes, in addition to intercellular clefts and fenestrations.
This gives them an appearance not unlike Swiss cheese. These very large openings allow for the passage of the largest
molecules, including plasma proteins and even cells. Blood flow through sinusoids is very slow, allowing more time for
exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes. Sinusoids are found in the liver and spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes (where they
carry lymph, not blood), and many endocrine glands including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Without these specialized
capillaries, these organs would not be able to provide their myriad of functions. For example, when bone marrow forms new
blood cells, the cells must enter the blood supply and can only do so through the large openings of a sinusoid capillary; they
cannot pass through the small openings of continuous or fenestrated capillaries. The liver also requires extensive specialized
sinusoid capillaries in order to process the materials brought to it by the hepatic portal vein from both the digestive tract and
spleen, and to release plasma proteins into circulation.

Metarterioles and Capillary Beds

A metarteriole is a type of vessel that has structural characteristics of both an arteriole and a capillary. Slightly larger than
the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth
muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches
to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10-100 capillaries.

The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the
metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical:
If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in
the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. Normally, the precapillary
sphincters are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary
sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (Figure 20.6). If all of
the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare
channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. This creates what is known as a vascular
shunt. In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system.

Although you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular,
pulsating flow. This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to
changes in internal conditions, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels. For example, during
strenuous exercise when oxygen levels decrease and carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels all increase, the
capillary beds in skeletal muscle are open, as they would be in the digestive system when nutrients are present in the
digestive tract. During sleep or rest periods, vessels in both areas are largely closed; they open only occasionally to allow
oxygen and nutrient supplies to travel to the tissues to maintain basic life processes.

the junction of a metarteriole with a capillary regulate blood flow. A thoroughfare channel connects the metarteriole to
a venule. An arteriovenous anastomosis, which directly connects the arteriole with the venule, is shown at the bottom.

Venules

A venule is an extremely small vein, generally 8-100 micrometers in diameter. Postcapillary venules join multiple
capillaries exiting from a capillary bed. Multiple venules join to form veins. The walls of venules consist of endothelium,
a thin middle layer with a few muscle cells and elastic fibers, plus an outer layer of connective tissue fibers that constitute
a very thin tunica externa (Figure 20.7). Venules as well as capillaries are the primary sites of emigration or diapedesis, in
which the white blood cells adhere to the endothelial lining of the vessels and then squeeze through adjacent cells to enter
the tissue fluid.

Veins

A vein is a blood vessel that conducts blood toward the heart. Compared to arteries, veins are thin-walled vessels with large
and irregular lumens (see Figure 20.7). Because they are low-pressure vessels, larger veins are commonly equipped with
valves that promote the unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart and prevent backflow toward the capillaries caused
by the inherent low blood pressure in veins as well as the pull of gravity. Table 20.2 compares the features of arteries and
veins.

isorders OF THE...

Cardiovascular System: Edema and Varicose Veins

Despite the presence of valves and the contributions of other anatomical and physiological adaptations we will cover
shortly, over the course of a day, some blood will inevitably pool, especially in the lower limbs, due to the pull of
gravity. Any blood that accumulates in a vein will increase the pressure within it, which can then be reflected back into
the smaller veins, venules, and eventually even the capillaries. Increased pressure will promote the flow of fluids out
of the capillaries and into the interstitial fluid. The presence of excess tissue fluid around the cells leads to a condition
called edema.

Most people experience a daily accumulation of tissue fluid, especially if they spend much of their work life on
their feet (like most health professionals). However, clinical edema goes beyond normal swelling and requires medical
treatment. Edema has many potential causes, including hypertension and heart failure, severe protein deficiency, renal
failure, and many others. In order to treat edema, which is a sign rather than a discrete disorder, the underlying cause
must be diagnosed and alleviated.

Figure 20.8 Varicose Veins Varicose veins are commonly found in the lower limbs. (credit: Thomas Kriese)

Edema may be accompanied by varicose veins, especially in the superficial veins of the legs (Figure 20.8). This
disorder arises when defective valves allow blood to accumulate within the veins, causing them to distend, twist, and
become visible on the surface of the integument. Varicose veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in
women and are often related to pregnancy. More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful
and sometimes itchy or throbbing. Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support hose,
as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition. Laser surgery
and interventional radiologic procedures can reduce the size and severity of varicose veins. Severe cases may require
conventional surgery to remove the damaged vessels. As there are typically redundant circulation patterns, that is,
anastomoses, for the smaller and more superficial veins, removal does not typically impair the circulation. There is
evidence that patients with varicose veins suffer a greater risk of developing a thrombus or clot.

848 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Veins as Blood Reservoirs

In addition to their primary function of returning blood to the heart, veins may be considered blood reservoirs, since
systemic veins contain approximately 64 percent of the blood volume at any given time (Figure 20.9). Their ability to hold
this much blood is due to their high capacitance, that is, their capacity to distend (expand) readily to store a high volume
of blood, even at a low pressure. The large lumens and relatively thin walls of veins make them far more distensible than
arteries; thus, they are said to be capacitance vessels.

Figure 20.9 Distribution of Blood Flow

When blood flow needs to be redistributed to other portions of the body, the vasomotor center located in the medulla
oblongata sends sympathetic stimulation to the smooth muscles in the walls of the veins, causing constriction—or in this
case, venoconstriction. Less dramatic than the vasoconstriction seen in smaller arteries and arterioles, venoconstriction may
be likened to a “stiffening” of the vessel wall. This increases pressure on the blood within the veins, speeding its return to the
heart. As you will note in Figure 20.9, approximately 21 percent of the venous blood is located in venous networks within
the liver, bone marrow, and integument. This volume of blood is referred to as venous reserve. Through venoconstriction,
this “reserve” volume of blood can get back to the heart more quickly for redistribution to other parts of the circulation.

Vascular Surgeons and Technicians

Vascular surgery is a specialty in which the physician deals primarily with diseases of the vascular portion of the
cardiovascular system. This includes repair and replacement of diseased or damaged vessels, removal of plaque from
vessels, minimally invasive procedures including the insertion of venous catheters, and traditional surgery. Following
completion of medical school, the physician generally completes a 5-year surgical residency followed by an additional
1 to 2 years of vascular specialty training. In the United States, most vascular surgeons are members of the Society of
Vascular Surgery.

Vascular technicians are specialists in imaging technologies that provide information on the health of the vascular
system. They may also assist physicians in treating disorders involving the arteries and veins. This profession
often overlaps with cardiovascular technology, which would also include treatments involving the heart. Although
recognized by the American Medical Association, there are currently no licensing requirements for vascular
technicians, and licensing is voluntary. Vascular technicians typically have an Associate’s degree or certificate,
involving 18 months to 2 years of training. The United States Bureau of Labor projects this profession to grow by 29
percent from 2010 to 2020.

20.2 | Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Distinguish between systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure
¢ Describe the clinical measurement of pulse and blood pressure
¢ Identify and discuss five variables affecting arterial blood flow and blood pressure

* Discuss several factors affecting blood flow in the venous system

850 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Blood flow refers to the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ, and is usually expressed in terms of volume
of blood per unit of time. It is initiated by the contraction of the ventricles of the heart. Ventricular contraction ejects blood
into the major arteries, resulting in flow from regions of higher pressure to regions of lower pressure, as blood encounters
smaller arteries and arterioles, then capillaries, then the venules and veins of the venous system. This section discusses a
number of critical variables that contribute to blood flow throughout the body. It also discusses the factors that impede or
slow blood flow, a phenomenon known as resistance.

As noted earlier, hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by a fluid due to gravitational pull, usually against the wall
of the container in which it is located. One form of hydrostatic pressure is blood pressure, the force exerted by blood upon
the walls of the blood vessels or the chambers of the heart. Blood pressure may be measured in capillaries and veins, as
well as the vessels of the pulmonary circulation; however, the term blood pressure without any specific descriptors typically
refers to systemic arterial blood pressure—that is, the pressure of blood flowing in the arteries of the systemic circulation.
In clinical practice, this pressure is measured in mm Hg and is usually obtained using the brachial artery of the arm.

Components of Arterial Blood Pressure

Arterial blood pressure in the larger vessels consists of several distinct components (Figure 20.10): systolic and diastolic
pressures, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure.

Systolic and Diastolic Pressures

When systemic arterial blood pressure is measured, it is recorded as a ratio of two numbers (e.g., 120/80 is a normal adult
blood pressure), expressed as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the higher value (typically
around 120 mm Hg) and reflects the arterial pressure resulting from the ejection of blood during ventricular contraction, or
systole. The diastolic pressure is the lower value (usually about 80 mm Hg) and represents the arterial pressure of blood
during ventricular relaxation, or diastole.

Figure 20.10 Systemic Blood Pressure The graph shows the components of blood pressure throughout the blood
vessels, including systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, and pulse pressures.

Pulse Pressure

As shown in Figure 20.10, the difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure is the pulse pressure. For
example, an individual with a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg would have a pulse
pressure of 40 mmHg.

Generally, a pulse pressure should be at least 25 percent of the systolic pressure. A pulse pressure below this level
is described as low or narrow. This may occur, for example, in patients with a low stroke volume, which may be seen in
congestive heart failure, stenosis of the aortic valve, or significant blood loss following trauma. In contrast, a high or wide
pulse pressure is common in healthy people following strenuous exercise, when their resting pulse pressure of 30-40 mm
Hg may increase temporarily to 100 mm Hg as stroke volume increases. A persistently high pulse pressure at or above 100
mm Hg may indicate excessive resistance in the arteries and can be caused by a variety of disorders. Chronic high resting
pulse pressures can degrade the heart, brain, and kidneys, and warrant medical treatment.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 851

Mean Arterial Pressure

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) represents the “average” pressure of blood in the arteries, that is, the average force driving
blood into vessels that serve the tissues. Mean is a statistical concept and is calculated by taking the sum of the values
divided by the number of values. Although complicated to measure directly and complicated to calculate, MAP can be
approximated by adding the diastolic pressure to one-third of the pulse pressure or systolic pressure minus the diastolic
pressure:

MAP = diastolic BP + (systolic astole BP)

In Figure 20.10, this value is approximately 80 + (120 — 80) / 3, or 93.33. Normally, the MAP falls within the range of
70-110 mm Hg. If the value falls below 60 mm Hg for an extended time, blood pressure will not be high enough to ensure
circulation to and through the tissues, which results in ischemia, or insufficient blood flow. A condition called hypoxia,
inadequate oxygenation of tissues, commonly accompanies ischemia. The term hypoxemia refers to low levels of oxygen in
systemic arterial blood. Neurons are especially sensitive to hypoxia and may die or be damaged if blood flow and oxygen
supplies are not quickly restored.

Pulse

After blood is ejected from the heart, elastic fibers in the arteries help maintain a high-pressure gradient as they expand to
accommodate the blood, then recoil. This expansion and recoiling effect, known as the pulse, can be palpated manually or
measured electronically. Although the effect diminishes over distance from the heart, elements of the systolic and diastolic
components of the pulse are still evident down to the level of the arterioles.

Because pulse indicates heart rate, it is measured clinically to provide clues to a patient’s state of health. It is recorded
as beats per minute. Both the rate and the strength of the pulse are important clinically. A high or irregular pulse rate can
be caused by physical activity or other temporary factors, but it may also indicate a heart condition. The pulse strength
indicates the strength of ventricular contraction and cardiac output. If the pulse is strong, then systolic pressure is high. If it
is weak, systolic pressure has fallen, and medical intervention may be warranted.

Pulse can be palpated manually by placing the tips of the fingers across an artery that runs close to the body surface
and pressing lightly. While this procedure is normally performed using the radial artery in the wrist or the common carotid
artery in the neck, any superficial artery that can be palpated may be used (Figure 20.11). Common sites to find a pulse
include temporal and facial arteries in the head, brachial arteries in the upper arm, femoral arteries in the thigh, popliteal
arteries behind the knees, posterior tibial arteries near the medial tarsal regions, and dorsalis pedis arteries in the feet. A
variety of commercial electronic devices are also available to measure pulse.

Measurement of Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is one of the critical parameters measured on virtually every patient in every healthcare setting. The
technique used today was developed more than 100 years ago by a pioneering Russian physician, Dr. Nikolai Korotkoff.
Turbulent blood flow through the vessels can be heard as a soft ticking while measuring blood pressure; these sounds are
known as Korotkoff sounds. The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a
blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The technique is as follows:
¢ The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patient’s arm at about the level of the heart.
¢ The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising pressure around the artery and temporarily
cutting off blood flow into the patient’s arm.
¢ The clinician places the stethoscope on the patient’s antecubital region and, while gradually allowing air within the
cuff to escape, listens for the Korotkoff sounds.
Although there are five recognized Korotkoff sounds, only two are normally recorded. Initially, no sounds are heard
since there is no blood flow through the vessels, but as air pressure drops, the cuff relaxes, and blood flow returns to the arm.
As shown in Figure 20.12, the first sound heard through the stethoscope—the first Korotkoff sound—indicates systolic
pressure. As more air is released from the cuff, blood is able to flow freely through the brachial artery and all sounds
disappear. The point at which the last sound is heard is recorded as the patient’s diastolic pressure.

diastolic pressures.

The majority of hospitals and clinics have automated equipment for measuring blood pressure that work on the same
principles. An even more recent innovation is a small instrument that wraps around a patient’s wrist. The patient then holds
the wrist over the heart while the device measures blood flow and records pressure.

Variables Affecting Blood Flow and Blood Pressure

Five variables influence blood flow and blood pressure:

* Cardiac output

¢ Compliance

* Volume of the blood

¢ Viscosity of the blood

* Blood vessel length and diameter

Recall that blood moves from higher pressure to lower pressure. It is pumped from the heart into the arteries at high

pressure. If you increase pressure in the arteries (afterload), and cardiac function does not compensate, blood flow will
actually decrease. In the venous system, the opposite relationship is true. Increased pressure in the veins does not decrease
flow as it does in arteries, but actually increases flow. Since pressure in the veins is normally relatively low, for blood to
flow back into the heart, the pressure in the atria during atrial diastole must be even lower. It normally approaches zero,
except when the atria contract (see Figure 20.10).

Cardiac Output

Cardiac output is the measurement of blood flow from the heart through the ventricles, and is usually measured in liters
per minute. Any factor that causes cardiac output to increase, by elevating heart rate or stroke volume or both, will elevate
blood pressure and promote blood flow. These factors include sympathetic stimulation, the catecholamines epinephrine and
norepinephrine, thyroid hormones, and increased calcium ion levels. Conversely, any factor that decreases cardiac output,
by decreasing heart rate or stroke volume or both, will decrease arterial pressure and blood flow. These factors include
parasympathetic stimulation, elevated or decreased potassium ion levels, decreased calcium levels, anoxia, and acidosis.

Compliance

Compliance is the ability of any compartment to expand to accommodate increased content. A metal pipe, for example,
is not compliant, whereas a balloon is. The greater the compliance of an artery, the more effectively it is able to expand
to accommodate surges in blood flow without increased resistance or blood pressure. Veins are more compliant than
arteries and can expand to hold more blood. When vascular disease causes stiffening of arteries, compliance is reduced and
resistance to blood flow is increased. The result is more turbulence, higher pressure within the vessel, and reduced blood
flow. This increases the work of the heart.

A Mathematical Approach to Factors Affecting Blood Flow

Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille was a French physician and physiologist who devised a mathematical equation describing
blood flow and its relationship to known parameters. The same equation also applies to engineering studies of the flow of
fluids. Although understanding the math behind the relationships among the factors affecting blood flow is not necessary to

854 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

understand blood flow, it can help solidify an understanding of their relationships. Please note that even if the equation looks
intimidating, breaking it down into its components and following the relationships will make these relationships clearer,
even if you are weak in math. Focus on the three critical variables: radius (r), vessel length (A), and viscosity (n).
Poiseuille’s equation:

diameter. It may commonly be represented as 3.14, although the actual number extends to infinity.

+ 1‘ is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power.
* tis the Greek letter eta and represents the viscosity of the blood.
* is the Greek letter lambda and represents the length of a blood vessel.
One of several things this equation allows us to do is calculate the resistance in the vascular system. Normally this
value is extremely difficult to measure, but it can be calculated from this known relationship:

=—_ AP
Blood flow = Resistance
If we rearrange this slightly,
A = AP
Resistance = Blood flow
Then by substituting Pouseille’s equation for blood flow:
Resistance 8.
mw

By examining this equation, you can see that there are only three variables: viscosity, vessel length, and radius, since
8 and nm are both constants. The important thing to remember is this: Two of these variables, viscosity and vessel length,
will change slowly in the body. Only one of these factors, the radius, can be changed rapidly by vasoconstriction and
vasodilation, thus dramatically impacting resistance and flow. Further, small changes in the radius will greatly affect flow,
since it is raised to the fourth power in the equation.

We have briefly considered how cardiac output and blood volume impact blood flow and pressure; the next step is to
see how the other variables (contraction, vessel length, and viscosity) articulate with Pouseille’s equation and what they can
teach us about the impact on blood flow.

Blood Volume

The relationship between blood volume, blood pressure, and blood flow is intuitively obvious. Water may merely trickle
along a creek bed in a dry season, but rush quickly and under great pressure after a heavy rain. Similarly, as blood volume
decreases, pressure and flow decrease. As blood volume increases, pressure and flow increase.

Under normal circumstances, blood volume varies little. Low blood volume, called hypovolemia, may be caused by
bleeding, dehydration, vomiting, severe burns, or some medications used to treat hypertension. It is important to recognize
that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining blood pressure that an individual may be
asymptomatic until 10-20 percent of the blood volume has been lost. Treatment typically includes intravenous fluid
replacement.

Hypervolemia, excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of water and sodium, as seen in patients with
heart failure, liver cirrhosis, some forms of kidney disease, hyperaldosteronism, and some glucocorticoid steroid treatments.
Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the hypervolemia.

Blood Viscosity

Viscosity is the thickness of fluids that affects their ability to flow. Clean water, for example, is less viscous than mud.
The viscosity of blood is directly proportional to resistance and inversely proportional to flow; therefore, any condition
that causes viscosity to increase will also increase resistance and decrease flow. For example, imagine sipping milk, then
a milkshake, through the same size straw. You experience more resistance and therefore less flow from the milkshake.
Conversely, any condition that causes viscosity to decrease (such as when the milkshake melts) will decrease resistance and
increase flow.

Normally the viscosity of blood does not change over short periods of time. The two primary determinants of blood
viscosity are the formed elements and plasma proteins. Since the vast majority of formed elements are erythrocytes,
any condition affecting erythropoiesis, such as polycythemia or anemia, can alter viscosity. Since most plasma proteins
are produced by the liver, any condition affecting liver function can also change the viscosity slightly and therefore
decrease blood flow. Liver abnormalities include hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol damage, and drug toxicities. While leukocytes
and platelets are normally a small component of the formed elements, there are some rare conditions in which severe
overproduction can impact viscosity as well.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 855

Vessel Length and Diameter

The length of a vessel is directly proportional to its resistance: the longer the vessel, the greater the resistance and the lower
the flow. As with blood volume, this makes intuitive sense, since the increased surface area of the vessel will impede the
flow of blood. Likewise, if the vessel is shortened, the resistance will decrease and flow will increase.

The length of our blood vessels increases throughout childhood as we grow, of course, but is unchanging in adults
under normal physiological circumstances. Further, the distribution of vessels is not the same in all tissues. Adipose tissue
does not have an extensive vascular supply. One pound of adipose tissue contains approximately 200 miles of vessels,
whereas skeletal muscle contains more than twice that. Overall, vessels decrease in length only during loss of mass or
amputation. An individual weighing 150 pounds has approximately 60,000 miles of vessels in the body. Gaining about 10
pounds adds from 2000 to 4000 miles of vessels, depending upon the nature of the gained tissue. One of the great benefits
of weight reduction is the reduced stress to the heart, which does not have to overcome the resistance of as many miles of
vessels.

In contrast to length, the diameter of blood vessels changes throughout the body, according to the type of vessel, as we
discussed earlier. The diameter of any given vessel may also change frequently throughout the day in response to neural and
chemical signals that trigger vasodilation and vasoconstriction. The vascular tone of the vessel is the contractile state of the
smooth muscle and the primary determinant of diameter, and thus of resistance and flow. The effect of vessel diameter on
resistance is inverse: Given the same volume of blood, an increased diameter means there is less blood contacting the vessel
wall, thus lower friction and lower resistance, subsequently increasing flow. A decreased diameter means more of the blood
contacts the vessel wall, and resistance increases, subsequently decreasing flow.

The influence of lumen diameter on resistance is dramatic: A slight increase or decrease in diameter causes a huge
decrease or increase in resistance. This is because resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the blood vessel (one-

half of the vessel’s diameter) raised to the fourth power (R = 1/r*). This means, for example, that if an artery or arteriole
constricts to one-half of its original radius, the resistance to flow will increase 16 times. And if an artery or arteriole dilates
to twice its initial radius, then resistance in the vessel will decrease to 1/16 of its original value and flow will increase 16
times.

The Roles of Vessel Diameter and Total Area in Blood Flow and Blood Pressure

Recall that we classified arterioles as resistance vessels, because given their small lumen, they dramatically slow the flow
of blood from arteries. In fact, arterioles are the site of greatest resistance in the entire vascular network. This may seem
surprising, given that capillaries have a smaller size. How can this phenomenon be explained?

Figure 20.13 compares vessel diameter, total cross-sectional area, average blood pressure, and blood velocity through
the systemic vessels. Notice in parts (a) and (b) that the total cross-sectional area of the body’s capillary beds is far greater
than any other type of vessel. Although the diameter of an individual capillary is significantly smaller than the diameter
of an arteriole, there are vastly more capillaries in the body than there are other types of blood vessels. Part (c) shows that
blood pressure drops unevenly as blood travels from arteries to arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins, and encounters
greater resistance. However, the site of the most precipitous drop, and the site of greatest resistance, is the arterioles. This
explains why vasodilation and vasoconstriction of arterioles play more significant roles in regulating blood pressure than
do the vasodilation and vasoconstriction of other vessels.

Part (d) shows that the velocity (speed) of blood flow decreases dramatically as the blood moves from arteries to
arterioles to capillaries. This slow flow rate allows more time for exchange processes to occur. As blood flows through the
veins, the rate of velocity increases, as blood is returned to the heart.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 857

isorders |OF THE...

Cardiovascular System: Arteriosclerosis

Compliance allows an artery to expand when blood is pumped through it from the heart, and then to recoil after the
surge has passed. This helps promote blood flow. In arteriosclerosis, compliance is reduced, and pressure and resistance
within the vessel increase. This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as it causes the heart to
work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance.

Arteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high
blood glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors. Artery walls that are constantly stressed
by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension can promote
arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.

Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars
it, leaving it stiff (sclerotic). As a result, compliance is reduced. Moreover, circulating triglycerides and cholesterol can
seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they are frequently joined by
leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris. Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can narrow arteries enough to impair
blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = “porridge”) describes the mealy deposits (Figure
20.14).

deposits in an artery. (b) Plaques can also take other forms, as shown in this micrograph of a coronary artery
that has a buildup of connective tissue within the artery wall. LM x 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of
University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)

Sometimes a plaque can rupture, causing microscopic tears in the artery wall that allow blood to leak into the
tissue on the other side. When this happens, platelets rush to the site to clot the blood. This clot can further obstruct the
artery and—if it occurs in a coronary or cerebral artery—cause a sudden heart attack or stroke. Alternatively, plaque
can break off and travel through the bloodstream as an embolus until it blocks a more distant, smaller artery.

Even without total blockage, vessel narrowing leads to ischemia—reduced blood flow—to the tissue region
“downstream” of the narrowed vessel. Ischemia in turn leads to hypoxia—decreased supply of oxygen to the tissues.
Hypoxia involving cardiac muscle or brain tissue can lead to cell death and severe impairment of brain or heart
function.

A major risk factor for both arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis is advanced age, as the conditions tend to progress
over time. Arteriosclerosis is normally defined as the more generalized loss of compliance, “hardening of the arteries,”
whereas atherosclerosis is a more specific term for the build-up of plaque in the walls of the vessel and is a specific
type of arteriosclerosis. There is also a distinct genetic component, and pre-existing hypertension and/or diabetes also
greatly increase the risk. However, obesity, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use all are major risk
factors.

Treatment includes lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adoption of
a diet low in sodium and saturated fats. Medications to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure may be prescribed.
For blocked coronary arteries, surgery is warranted. In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted into the vessel at the point

858 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

of narrowing, and a second catheter with a balloon-like tip is inflated to widen the opening. To prevent subsequent
collapse of the vessel, a small mesh tube called a stent is often inserted. In an endarterectomy, plaque is surgically
removed from the walls of a vessel. This operation is typically performed on the carotid arteries of the neck, which are
a prime source of oxygenated blood for the brain. In a coronary bypass procedure, a non-vital superficial vessel from
another part of the body (often the great saphenous vein) or a synthetic vessel is inserted to create a path around the
blocked area of a coronary artery.

Venous System

The pumping action of the heart propels the blood into the arteries, from an area of higher pressure toward an area of lower
pressure. If blood is to flow from the veins back into the heart, the pressure in the veins must be greater than the pressure
in the atria of the heart. Two factors help maintain this pressure gradient between the veins and the heart. First, the pressure
in the atria during diastole is very low, often approaching zero when the atria are relaxed (atrial diastole). Second, two
physiologic “pumps” increase pressure in the venous system. The use of the term “pump” implies a physical device that
speeds flow. These physiological pumps are less obvious.

Skeletal Muscle Pump

In many body regions, the pressure within the veins can be increased by the contraction of the surrounding skeletal muscle.
This mechanism, known as the skeletal muscle pump (Figure 20.15), helps the lower-pressure veins counteract the force
of gravity, increasing pressure to move blood back to the heart. As leg muscles contract, for example during walking or
running, they exert pressure on nearby veins with their numerous one-way valves. This increased pressure causes blood to
flow upward, opening valves superior to the contracting muscles so blood flows through. Simultaneously, valves inferior
to the contracting muscles close; thus, blood should not seep back downward toward the feet. Military recruits are trained
to flex their legs slightly while standing at attention for prolonged periods. Failure to do so may allow blood to pool in the
lower limbs rather than returning to the heart. Consequently, the brain will not receive enough oxygenated blood, and the
individual may lose consciousness.

Muscles relaxed, Muscles contracted,
valves closed valve above muscle opens

Figure 20.15 Skeletal Muscle Pump The contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding a vein compresses the blood
and increases the pressure in that area. This action forces blood closer to the heart where venous pressure is lower.
Note the importance of the one-way valves to assure that blood flows only in the proper direction.

Respiratory Pump

The respiratory pump aids blood flow through the veins of the thorax and abdomen. During inhalation, the volume of the
thorax increases, largely through the contraction of the diaphragm, which moves downward and compresses the abdominal
cavity. The elevation of the chest caused by the contraction of the external intercostal muscles also contributes to the
increased volume of the thorax. The volume increase causes air pressure within the thorax to decrease, allowing us to inhale.
Additionally, as air pressure within the thorax drops, blood pressure in the thoracic veins also decreases, falling below the
pressure in the abdominal veins. This causes blood to flow along its pressure gradient from veins outside the thorax, where

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 859

pressure is higher, into the thoracic region, where pressure is now lower. This in turn promotes the return of blood from the
thoracic veins to the atria. During exhalation, when air pressure increases within the thoracic cavity, pressure in the thoracic
veins increases, speeding blood flow into the heart while valves in the veins prevent blood from flowing backward from the
thoracic and abdominal veins.

Pressure Relationships in the Venous System

Although vessel diameter increases from the smaller venules to the larger veins and eventually to the venae cavae (singular
= vena cava), the total cross-sectional area actually decreases (see Figure 20.15a and b). The individual veins are larger in
diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional area is also lower.

Also notice that, as blood moves from venules to veins, the average blood pressure drops (see Figure 20.15c), but
the blood velocity actually increases (see Figure 20.15). This pressure gradient drives blood back toward the heart. Again,
the presence of one-way valves and the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps contribute to this increased flow. Since
approximately 64 percent of the total blood volume resides in systemic veins, any action that increases the flow of blood
through the veins will increase venous return to the heart. Maintaining vascular tone within the veins prevents the veins
from merely distending, dampening the flow of blood, and as you will see, vasoconstriction actually enhances the flow.

The Role of Venoconstriction in Resistance, Blood Pressure, and Flow

As previously discussed, vasoconstriction of an artery or arteriole decreases the radius, increasing resistance and pressure,
but decreasing flow. Venoconstriction, on the other hand, has a very different outcome. The walls of veins are thin but
irregular; thus, when the smooth muscle in those walls constricts, the lumen becomes more rounded. The more rounded
the lumen, the less surface area the blood encounters, and the less resistance the vessel offers. Vasoconstriction increases
pressure within a vein as it does in an artery, but in veins, the increased pressure increases flow. Recall that the pressure
in the atria, into which the venous blood will flow, is very low, approaching zero for at least part of the relaxation phase
of the cardiac cycle. Thus, venoconstriction increases the return of blood to the heart. Another way of stating this is that
venoconstriction increases the preload or stretch of the cardiac muscle and increases contraction.

20.3 | Capillary Exchange

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the primary mechanisms of capillary exchange

¢ Distinguish between capillary hydrostatic pressure and blood colloid osmotic pressure, explaining the contribution
of each to net filtration pressure

* Compare filtration and reabsorption
¢ Explain the fate of fluid that is not reabsorbed from the tissues into the vascular capillaries

The primary purpose of the cardiovascular system is to circulate gases, nutrients, wastes, and other substances to and from
the cells of the body. Small molecules, such as gases, lipids, and lipid-soluble molecules, can diffuse directly through the
membranes of the endothelial cells of the capillary wall. Glucose, amino acids, and ions—including sodium, potassium,
calcium, and chloride—use transporters to move through specific channels in the membrane by facilitated diffusion.
Glucose, ions, and larger molecules may also leave the blood through intercellular clefts. Larger molecules can pass through
the pores of fenestrated capillaries, and even large plasma proteins can pass through the great gaps in the sinusoids. Some
large proteins in blood plasma can move into and out of the endothelial cells packaged within vesicles by endocytosis and
exocytosis. Water moves by osmosis.

Bulk Flow

The mass movement of fluids into and out of capillary beds requires a transport mechanism far more efficient than mere
diffusion. This movement, often referred to as bulk flow, involves two pressure-driven mechanisms: Volumes of fluid move
from an area of higher pressure in a capillary bed to an area of lower pressure in the tissues via filtration. In contrast,
the movement of fluid from an area of higher pressure in the tissues into an area of lower pressure in the capillaries is
reabsorption. Two types of pressure interact to drive each of these movements: hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure.

Hydrostatic Pressure

The primary force driving fluid transport between the capillaries and tissues is hydrostatic pressure, which can be defined
as the pressure of any fluid enclosed in a space. Blood hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by the blood confined
within blood vessels or heart chambers. Even more specifically, the pressure exerted by blood against the wall of a capillary
is called capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP), and is the same as capillary blood pressure. CHP is the force that drives
fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues.

As fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid correspondingly
rises. This opposing hydrostatic pressure is called the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Generally, the CHP
originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are continually


860 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

absorbing excess fluid from the tissues. Thus, fluid generally moves out of the capillary and into the interstitial fluid. This
process is called filtration.

Osmotic Pressure

The net pressure that drives reabsorption—the movement of fluid from the interstitial fluid back into the capillaries—is
called osmotic pressure (sometimes referred to as oncotic pressure). Whereas hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out of the
capillary, osmotic pressure draws fluid back in. Osmotic pressure is determined by osmotic concentration gradients, that is,
the difference in the solute-to-water concentrations in the blood and tissue fluid. A region higher in solute concentration (and
lower in water concentration) draws water across a semipermeable membrane from a region higher in water concentration
(and lower in solute concentration).

As we discuss osmotic pressure in blood and tissue fluid, it is important to recognize that the formed elements of blood
do not contribute to osmotic concentration gradients. Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role. Solutes also
move across the capillary wall according to their concentration gradient, but overall, the concentrations should be similar
and not have a significant impact on osmosis. Because of their large size and chemical structure, plasma proteins are not
truly solutes, that is, they do not dissolve but are dispersed or suspended in their fluid medium, forming a colloid rather than
a solution.

The pressure created by the concentration of colloidal proteins in the blood is called the blood colloidal osmotic
pressure (BCOP). Its effect on capillary exchange accounts for the reabsorption of water. The plasma proteins suspended
in blood cannot move across the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the plasma. As a result,
blood has a higher colloidal concentration and lower water concentration than tissue fluid. It therefore attracts water. We can
also say that the BCOP is higher than the interstitial fluid colloidal osmotic pressure (IFCOP), which is always very low
because interstitial fluid contains few proteins. Thus, water is drawn from the tissue fluid back into the capillary, carrying
dissolved molecules with it. This difference in colloidal osmotic pressure accounts for reabsorption.

Interaction of Hydrostatic and Osmotic Pressures

The normal unit used to express pressures within the cardiovascular system is millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). When blood
leaving an arteriole first enters a capillary bed, the CHP is quite high—about 35 mm Hg. Gradually, this initial CHP declines
as the blood moves through the capillary so that by the time the blood has reached the venous end, the CHP has dropped
to approximately 18 mm Hg. In comparison, the plasma proteins remain suspended in the blood, so the BCOP remains
‘airly constant at about 25 mm Hg throughout the length of the capillary and considerably below the osmotic pressure in the
interstitial fluid.

The net filtration pressure (NFP) represents the interaction of the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures, driving fluid out
of the capillary. It is equal to the difference between the CHP and the BCOP. Since filtration is, by definition, the movement
of fluid out of the capillary, when reabsorption is occurring, the NFP is a negative number.

NFP changes at different points in a capillary bed (Figure 20.16). Close to the arterial end of the capillary, it is
approximately 10 mm Hg, because the CHP of 35 mm Hg minus the BCOP of 25 mm Hg equals 10 mm Hg. Recall that the
hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of the interstitial fluid are essentially negligible. Thus, the NFP of 10 mm Hg drives a net
movement of fluid out of the capillary at the arterial end. At approximately the middle of the capillary, the CHP is about the
same as the BCOP of 25 mm Hg, so the NFP drops to zero. At this point, there is no net change of volume: Fluid moves out
of the capillary at the same rate as it moves into the capillary. Near the venous end of the capillary, the CHP has dwindled
to about 18 mm Hg due to loss of fluid. Because the BCOP remains steady at 25 mm Hg, water is drawn into the capillary,
that is, reabsorption occurs. Another way of expressing this is to say that at the venous end of the capillary, there is an NFP
of -7 mm Hg.

Figure 20.16 Capillary Exchange Net filtration occurs near the arterial end of the capillary since capillary hydrostatic
pressure (CHP) is greater than blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP). There is no net movement of fluid near the
midpoint since CHP = BCOP. Net reabsorption occurs near the venous end since BCOP is greater than CHP.

The Role of Lymphatic Capillaries

Since overall CHP is higher than BCOP, it is inevitable that more net fluid will exit the capillary through filtration at the
arterial end than enters through reabsorption at the venous end. Considering all capillaries over the course of a day, this can
be quite a substantial amount of fluid: Approximately 24 liters per day are filtered, whereas 20.4 liters are reabsorbed. This
excess fluid is picked up by capillaries of the lymphatic system. These extremely thin-walled vessels have copious numbers
of valves that ensure unidirectional flow through ever-larger lymphatic vessels that eventually drain into the subclavian
veins in the neck. An important function of the lymphatic system is to return the fluid (lymph) to the blood. Lymph may be
thought of as recycled blood plasma. (Seek additional content for more detail on the lymphatic system.)

20.4 | Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Discuss the mechanisms involved in the neural regulation of vascular homeostasis
¢ Describe the contribution of a variety of hormones to the renal regulation of blood pressure
* Identify the effects of exercise on vascular homeostasis
* Discuss how hypertension, hemorrhage, and circulatory shock affect vascular health

In order to maintain homeostasis in the cardiovascular system and provide adequate blood to the tissues, blood flow must
be redirected continually to the tissues as they become more active. In a very real sense, the cardiovascular system engages
in resource allocation, because there is not enough blood flow to distribute blood equally to all tissues simultaneously.
For example, when an individual is exercising, more blood will be directed to skeletal muscles, the heart, and the lungs.

862 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Following a meal, more blood is directed to the digestive system. Only the brain receives a more or less constant supply of
blood whether you are active, resting, thinking, or engaged in any other activity.

Table 20.3 provides the distribution of systemic blood at rest and during exercise. Although most of the data appears
logical, the values for the distribution of blood to the integument may seem surprising. During exercise, the body distributes
more blood to the body surface where it can dissipate the excess heat generated by increased activity into the environment.

Neural Regulation

The nervous system plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis. The primary regulatory sites include the
cardiovascular centers in the brain that control both cardiac and vascular functions. In addition, more generalized neural
responses from the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system are factors.

The Cardiovascular Centers in the Brain

Neurological regulation of blood pressure and flow depends on the cardiovascular centers located in the medulla oblongata.

This cluster of neurons responds to changes in blood pressure as well as blood concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide,

and hydrogen ions. The cardiovascular center contains three distinct paired components:

* The cardioaccelerator centers stimulate cardiac function by regulating heart rate and stroke volume via sympathetic
stimulation from the cardiac accelerator nerve.

863

864 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

* The cardioinhibitor centers slow cardiac function by decreasing heart rate and stroke volume via parasympathetic
stimulation from the vagus nerve.

* The vasomotor centers control vessel tone or contraction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media. Changes in
diameter affect peripheral resistance, pressure, and flow, which affect cardiac output. The majority of these neurons
act via the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons.

Although each center functions independently, they are not anatomically distinct.

There is also a small population of neurons that control vasodilation in the vessels of the brain and skeletal muscles
by relaxing the smooth muscle fibers in the vessel tunics. Many of these are cholinergic neurons, that is, they release
acetylcholine, which in turn stimulates the vessels’ endothelial cells to release nitric oxide (NO), which causes vasodilation.
Others release norepinephrine that binds to B2 receptors. A few neurons release NO directly as a neurotransmitter.

Recall that mild stimulation of the skeletal muscles maintains muscle tone. A similar phenomenon occurs with vascular
tone in vessels. As noted earlier, arterioles are normally partially constricted: With maximal stimulation, their radius may
be reduced to one-half of the resting state. Full dilation of most arterioles requires that this sympathetic stimulation be
suppressed. When it is, an arteriole can expand by as much as 150 percent. Such a significant increase can dramatically
affect resistance, pressure, and flow.

Baroreceptor Reflexes

Baroreceptors are specialized stretch receptors located within thin areas of blood vessels and heart chambers that respond
to the degree of stretch caused by the presence of blood. They send impulses to the cardiovascular center to regulate blood
pressure. Vascular baroreceptors are found primarily in sinuses (small cavities) within the aorta and carotid arteries: The
aortic sinuses are found in the walls of the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic valve, whereas the carotid sinuses are
in the base of the internal carotid arteries. There are also low-pressure baroreceptors located in the walls of the venae cavae
and right atrium.

When blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched more tightly and initiate action potentials at a higher
rate. At lower blood pressures, the degree of stretch is lower and the rate of firing is slower. When the cardiovascular center
in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis (Figure 20.18):

* When blood pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic stimulation
of the heart. As a result, cardiac output falls. Sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral arterioles will also decrease,
resulting in vasodilation. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to fall.

* When blood pressure drops too low, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases. This will trigger an increase in
sympathetic stimulation of the heart, causing cardiac output to increase. It will also trigger sympathetic stimulation of
the peripheral vessels, resulting in vasoconstriction. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to rise.

Figure 20.18 Baroreceptor Reflexes for Maintaining Vascular Homeostasis Increased blood pressure results in
increased rates of baroreceptor firing, whereas decreased blood pressure results in slower rates of fire, both initiating
the homeostatic mechanism to restore blood pressure.

The baroreceptors in the venae cavae and right atrium monitor blood pressure as the blood returns to the heart from
the systemic circulation. Normally, blood flow into the aorta is the same as blood flow back into the right atrium. If blood
is returning to the right atrium more rapidly than it is being ejected from the left ventricle, the atrial receptors will stimulate
the cardiovascular centers to increase sympathetic firing and increase cardiac output until homeostasis is achieved. The
opposite is also true. This mechanism is referred to as the atrial reflex.

Chemoreceptor Reflexes

In addition to the baroreceptors are chemoreceptors that monitor levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions (pH),
and thereby contribute to vascular homeostasis. Chemoreceptors monitoring the blood are located in close proximity to the
baroreceptors in the aortic and carotid sinuses. They signal the cardiovascular center as well as the respiratory centers in the
medulla oblongata.
Since tissues consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide and acids as waste products, when the body is more active,
oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide levels rise as cells undergo cellular respiration to meet the energy needs of activities.
This causes more hydrogen ions to be produced, causing the blood pH to drop. When the body is resting, oxygen levels
are higher, carbon dioxide levels are lower, more hydrogen is bound, and pH rises. (Seek additional content for more detail
about pH.)
The chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the
cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers, increasing cardiac output and constricting peripheral vessels. The cardioinhibitor
centers are suppressed. With falling carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (increasing pH), the cardioinhibitor centers
are stimulated, and the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers are suppressed, decreasing cardiac output and causing
peripheral vasodilation. In order to maintain adequate supplies of oxygen to the cells and remove waste products such as
carbon dioxide, it is essential that the respiratory system respond to changing metabolic demands. In turn, the cardiovascular
system will transport these gases to the lungs for exchange, again in accordance with metabolic demands. This
interrelationship of cardiovascular and respiratory control cannot be overemphasized.

Other neural mechanisms can also have a significant impact on cardiovascular function. These include the limbic
system that links physiological responses to psychological stimuli, as well as generalized sympathetic and parasympathetic
stimulation.

Endocrine Regulation

Endocrine control over the cardiovascular system involves the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as
several hormones that interact with the kidneys in the regulation of blood volume.

866 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

Epinephrine and Norepinephrine

The catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla, and enhance and extend the
body’s sympathetic or “fight-or-flight” response (see Figure 20.17). They increase heart rate and force of contraction, while
temporarily constricting blood vessels to organs not essential for flight-or-fight responses and redirecting blood flow to the
liver, muscles, and heart.

Antidiuretic Hormone

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is secreted by the cells in the hypothalamus and transported via
the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tracts to the posterior pituitary where it is stored until released upon nervous stimulation.
The primary trigger prompting the hypothalamus to release ADH is increasing osmolarity of tissue fluid, usually in response
to significant loss of blood volume. ADH signals its target cells in the kidneys to reabsorb more water, thus preventing the
loss of additional fluid in the urine. This will increase overall fluid levels and help restore blood volume and pressure. In
addition, ADH constricts peripheral vessels.

Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Mechanism

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism has a major effect upon the cardiovascular system (Figure 20.19). Renin is
an enzyme, although because of its importance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, some sources identify it as
a hormone. Specialized cells in the kidneys found in the juxtaglomerular apparatus respond to decreased blood flow by
secreting renin into the blood. Renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver, into its
active form—angiotensin I. Angiotensin I circulates in the blood and is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs. This
reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).

Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, greatly increasing blood pressure. It also stimulates the release of ADH
and aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium into the blood
by the kidneys. Since water follows sodium, this increases the reabsorption of water. This in turn increases blood volume,
raising blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, so an individual will likely
consume more fluids, again increasing blood volume and pressure.

Figure 20.19 Hormones Involved in Renal Contro! of Blood Pressure In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
mechanism, increasing angiotensin II will stimulate the production of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone. In addition
to renin, the kidneys produce erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, further increasing blood
volume.

Erythropoietin

Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by the kidneys when blood flow and/or oxygen levels decrease. EPO stimulates the
production of erythrocytes within the bone marrow. Erythrocytes are the major formed element of the blood and may
contribute 40 percent or more to blood volume, a significant factor of viscosity, resistance, pressure, and flow. In
addition, EPO is a vasoconstrictor. Overproduction of EPO or excessive intake of synthetic EPO, often to enhance athletic
performance, will increase viscosity, resistance, and pressure, and decrease flow in addition to its contribution as a
vasoconstrictor.

Atrial Natriuretic Hormone

Secreted by cells in the atria of the heart, atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide) is
secreted when blood volume is high enough to cause extreme stretching of the cardiac cells. Cells in the ventricle produce
a hormone with similar effects, called B-type natriuretic hormone. Natriuretic hormones are antagonists to angiotensin II.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 867

They promote loss of sodium and water from the kidneys, and suppress renin, aldosterone, and ADH production and release.
All of these actions promote loss of fluid from the body, so blood volume and blood pressure drop.

Autoregulation of Perfusion

As the name would suggest, autoregulation mechanisms require neither specialized nervous stimulation nor endocrine
control. Rather, these are local, self-regulatory mechanisms that allow each region of tissue to adjust its blood flow—and
thus its perfusion. These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls.

Chemical Signals Involved in Autoregulation

Chemical signals work at the level of the precapillary sphincters to trigger either constriction or relaxation. As you know,
opening a precapillary sphincter allows blood to flow into that particular capillary, whereas constricting a precapillary
sphincter temporarily shuts off blood flow to that region. The factors involved in regulating the precapillary sphincters
include the following:
* Opening of the sphincter is triggered in response to decreased oxygen concentrations; increased carbon dioxide
concentrations; increasing levels of lactic acid or other byproducts of cellular metabolism; increasing concentrations

of potassium ions or hydrogen ions (falling pH); inflammatory chemicals such as histamines; and increased body
temperature. These conditions in turn stimulate the release of NO, a powerful vasodilator, from endothelial cells (see

Figure 20.17).

* Contraction of the precapillary sphincter is triggered by the opposite levels of the regulators, which prompt the
release of endothelins, powerful vasoconstricting peptides secreted by endothelial cells. Platelet secretions and certain
prostaglandins may also trigger constriction.

Again, these factors alter tissue perfusion via their effects on the precapillary sphincter mechanism, which regulates
blood flow to capillaries. Since the amount of blood is limited, not all capillaries can fill at once, so blood flow is allocated
based upon the needs and metabolic state of the tissues as reflected in these parameters. Bear in mind, however, that dilation
and constriction of the arterioles feeding the capillary beds is the primary control mechanism.

The Myogenic Response

The myogenic response is a reaction to the stretching of the smooth muscle in the walls of arterioles as changes in blood
flow occur through the vessel. This may be viewed as a largely protective function against dramatic fluctuations in blood
pressure and blood flow to maintain homeostasis. If perfusion of an organ is too low (ischemia), the tissue will experience
low levels of oxygen (hypoxia). In contrast, excessive perfusion could damage the organ’s smaller and more fragile vessels.
The myogenic response is a localized process that serves to stabilize blood flow in the capillary network that follows that
arteriole.

When blood flow is low, the vessel’s smooth muscle will be only minimally stretched. In response, it relaxes, allowing
the vessel to dilate and thereby increase the movement of blood into the tissue. When blood flow is too high, the smooth
muscle will contract in response to the increased stretch, prompting vasoconstriction that reduces blood flow.

Figure 20.20 summarizes the effects of nervous, endocrine, and local controls on arterioles.

Effect of Exercise on Vascular Homeostasis

The heart is a muscle and, like any muscle, it responds dramatically to exercise. For a healthy young adult, cardiac output
(heart rate x stroke volume) increases in the nonathlete from approximately 5.0 liters (5.25 quarts) per minute to a maximum
of about 20 liters (21 quarts) per minute. Accompanying this will be an increase in blood pressure from about 120/80 to
185/75. However, well-trained aerobic athletes can increase these values substantially. For these individuals, cardiac output
soars from approximately 5.3 liters (5.57 quarts) per minute resting to more than 30 liters (31.5 quarts) per minute during
maximal exercise. Along with this increase in cardiac output, blood pressure increases from 120/80 at rest to 200/90 at
maximum values.

In addition to improved cardiac function, exercise increases the size and mass of the heart. The average weight of the
heart for the nonathlete is about 300 g, whereas in an athlete it will increase to 500 g. This increase in size generally makes
the heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, increasing both stroke volume and cardiac output.

Tissue perfusion also increases as the body transitions from a resting state to light exercise and eventually to heavy
exercise (see Figure 20.20). These changes result in selective vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, heart, lungs, liver, and
integument. Simultaneously, vasoconstriction occurs in the vessels leading to the kidneys and most of the digestive and
reproductive organs. The flow of blood to the brain remains largely unchanged whether at rest or exercising, since the
vessels in the brain largely do not respond to regulatory stimuli, in most cases, because they lack the appropriate receptors.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 869

As vasodilation occurs in selected vessels, resistance drops and more blood rushes into the organs they supply. This
blood eventually returns to the venous system. Venous return is further enhanced by both the skeletal muscle and respiratory
pumps. As blood returns to the heart more quickly, preload rises and the Frank-Starling principle tells us that contraction
of the cardiac muscle in the atria and ventricles will be more forceful. Eventually, even the best-trained athletes will fatigue
and must undergo a period of rest following exercise. Cardiac output and distribution of blood then return to normal.

Regular exercise promotes cardiovascular health in a variety of ways. Because an athlete’s heart is larger than a
nonathlete’s, stroke volume increases, so the athletic heart can deliver the same amount of blood as the nonathletic heart but
with a lower heart rate. This increased efficiency allows the athlete to exercise for longer periods of time before muscles
fatigue and places less stress on the heart. Exercise also lowers overall cholesterol levels by removing from the circulation
a complex form of cholesterol, triglycerides, and proteins known as low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are widely
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although there is no way to remove deposits of plaque from the
walls of arteries other than specialized surgery, exercise does promote the health of vessels by decreasing the rate of plaque
formation and reducing blood pressure, so the heart does not have to generate as much force to overcome resistance.

Generally as little as 30 minutes of noncontinuous exercise over the course of each day has beneficial effects and has
been shown to lower the rate of heart attack by nearly 50 percent. While it is always advisable to follow a healthy diet,
stop smoking, and lose weight, studies have clearly shown that fit, overweight people may actually be healthier overall than
sedentary slender people. Thus, the benefits of moderate exercise are undeniable.

Clinical Considerations in Vascular Homeostasis

Any disorder that affects blood volume, vascular tone, or any other aspect of vascular functioning is likely to affect vascular
homeostasis as well. That includes hypertension, hemorrhage, and shock.

Hypertension and Hypotension

Chronically elevated blood pressure is known clinically as hypertension. It is defined as chronic and persistent blood
pressure measurements of 140/90 mm Hg or above. Pressures between 120/80 and 140/90 mm Hg are defined as
prehypertension. About 68 million Americans currently suffer from hypertension. Unfortunately, hypertension is typically
a silent disorder; therefore, hypertensive patients may fail to recognize the seriousness of their condition and fail to follow
their treatment plan. The result is often a heart attack or stroke. Hypertension may also lead to an aneurism (ballooning of a
blood vessel caused by a weakening of the wall), peripheral arterial disease (obstruction of vessels in peripheral regions of
the body), chronic kidney disease, or heart failure.

as a “silent killer.” What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke?

Hemorrhage

Minor blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair. Hemorrhage is a loss of blood that cannot be controlled by
hemostatic mechanisms. Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing blood
pressure and maintaining blood flow. Ultimately, however, blood volume will need to be restored, either through
physiological processes or through medical intervention.

In response to blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate sympathetic
responses to increase cardiac output and vasoconstriction. This typically prompts the heart rate to increase to about 180-200
contractions per minute, restoring cardiac output to normal levels. Vasoconstriction of the arterioles increases vascular
resistance, whereas constriction of the veins increases venous return to the heart. Both of these steps will help increase blood
pressure. Sympathetic stimulation also triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which enhance both cardiac
output and vasoconstriction. If blood loss were less than 20 percent of total blood volume, these responses together would
usually return blood pressure to normal and redirect the remaining blood to the tissues.

Additional endocrine involvement is necessary, however, to restore the lost blood volume. The angiotensin-renin-
aldosterone mechanism stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, which increases fluid consumption to help restore


870 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

the lost blood. More importantly, it increases renal reabsorption of sodium and water, reducing water loss in urine output.
The kidneys also increase the production of EPO, stimulating the formation of erythrocytes that not only deliver oxygen to
the tissues but also increase overall blood volume. Figure 20.21 summarizes the responses to loss of blood volume.

Circulatory Shock

The loss of too much blood may lead to circulatory shock, a life-threatening condition in which the circulatory system is
unable to maintain blood flow to adequately supply sufficient oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues to maintain cellular
metabolism. It should not be confused with emotional or psychological shock. Typically, the patient in circulatory shock will
demonstrate an increased heart rate but decreased blood pressure, but there are cases in which blood pressure will remain
normal. Urine output will fall dramatically, and the patient may appear confused or lose consciousness. Urine output less
than 1 mL/kg body weight/hour is cause for concern. Unfortunately, shock is an example of a positive-feedback loop that,
if uncorrected, may lead to the death of the patient.
There are several recognized forms of shock:

* Hypovolemic shock in adults is typically caused by hemorrhage, although in children it may be caused by fluid
losses related to severe vomiting or diarrhea. Other causes for hypovolemic shock include extensive burns, exposure
to some toxins, and excessive urine loss related to diabetes insipidus or ketoacidosis. Typically, patients present with
a rapid, almost tachycardic heart rate; a weak pulse often described as “thread;” cool, clammy skin, particularly in
the extremities, due to restricted peripheral blood flow; rapid, shallow breathing; hypothermia; thirst; and dry mouth.
Treatments generally involve providing intravenous fluids to restore the patient to normal function and various drugs
such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise blood pressure.

* Cardiogenic shock results from the inability of the heart to maintain cardiac output. Most often, it results from a
myocardial infarction (heart attack), but it may also be caused by arrhythmias, valve disorders, cardiomyopathies,
cardiac failure, or simply insufficient flow of blood through the cardiac vessels. Treatment involves repairing the
damage to the heart or its vessels to resolve the underlying cause, rather than treating cardiogenic shock directly.

* Vascular shock occurs when arterioles lose their normal muscular tone and dilate dramatically. It may arise from a
variety of causes, and treatments almost always involve fluid replacement and medications, called inotropic or pressor
agents, which restore tone to the muscles of the vessels. In addition, eliminating or at least alleviating the underlying
cause of the condition is required. This might include antibiotics and antihistamines, or select steroids, which may
aid in the repair of nerve damage. A common cause is sepsis (or septicemia), also called “blood poisoning,” which
is a widespread bacterial infection that results in an organismal-level inflammatory response known as septic shock.
Neurogenic shock is a form of vascular shock that occurs with cranial or spinal injuries that damage the cardiovascular
centers in the medulla oblongata or the nervous fibers originating from this region. Anaphylactic shock is a severe
allergic response that causes the widespread release of histamines, triggering vasodilation throughout the body.

* Obstructive shock, as the name would suggest, occurs when a significant portion of the vascular system is blocked.
It is not always recognized as a distinct condition and may be grouped with cardiogenic shock, including pulmonary
embolism and cardiac tamponade. Treatments depend upon the underlying cause and, in addition to administering
fluids intravenously, often include the administration of anticoagulants, removal of fluid from the pericardial cavity,
or air from the thoracic cavity, and surgery as required. The most common cause is a pulmonary embolism, a clot that
lodges in the pulmonary vessels and interrupts blood flow. Other causes include stenosis of the aortic valve; cardiac
tamponade, in which excess fluid in the pericardial cavity interferes with the ability of the heart to fully relax and fill
with blood (resulting in decreased preload); and a pneumothorax, in which an excessive amount of air is present in the

to the tissues.

20.5 | Circulatory Pathways

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the vessels through which blood travels within the pulmonary circuit, beginning from the right ventricle of
the heart and ending at the left atrium
* Create a flow chart showing the major systemic arteries through which blood travels from the aorta and its major
branches, to the most significant arteries feeding into the right and left upper and lower limbs
* Create a flow chart showing the major systemic veins through which blood travels from the feet to the right atrium
of the heart

Virtually every cell, tissue, organ, and system in the body is impacted by the circulatory system. This includes the
generalized and more specialized functions of transport of materials, capillary exchange, maintaining health by transporting
white blood cells and various immunoglobulins (antibodies), hemostasis, regulation of body temperature, and helping to
maintain acid-base balance. In addition to these shared functions, many systems enjoy a unique relationship with the
circulatory system. Figure 20.22 summarizes these relationships.

Figure 20.22 Interaction of the Circulatory System with Other Body Systems

As you learn about the vessels of the systemic and pulmonary circuits, notice that many arteries and veins share the
same names, parallel one another throughout the body, and are very similar on the right and left sides of the body. These
pairs of vessels will be traced through only one side of the body. Where differences occur in branching patterns or when
vessels are singular, this will be indicated. For example, you will find a pair of femoral arteries and a pair of femoral
veins, with one vessel on each side of the body. In contrast, some vessels closer to the midline of the body, such as the
aorta, are unique. Moreover, some superficial veins, such as the great saphenous vein in the femoral region, have no arterial
counterpart. Another phenomenon that can make the study of vessels challenging is that names of vessels can change with
location. Like a street that changes name as it passes through an intersection, an artery or vein can change names as it passes
an anatomical landmark. For example, the left subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery as it passes through the body
wall and into the axillary region, and then becomes the brachial artery as it flows from the axillary region into the upper arm
(or brachium). You will also find examples of anastomoses where two blood vessels that previously branched reconnect.
Anastomoses are especially common in veins, where they help maintain blood flow even when one vessel is blocked or
narrowed, although there are some important ones in the arteries supplying the brain.

As you read about circular pathways, notice that there is an occasional, very large artery referred to as a trunk, a term
indicating that the vessel gives rise to several smaller arteries. For example, the celiac trunk gives rise to the left gastric,
common hepatic, and splenic arteries.

As you study this section, imagine you are on a “Voyage of Discovery” similar to Lewis and Clark’s expedition in
1804-1806, which followed rivers and streams through unfamiliar territory, seeking a water route from the Atlantic to

system. This simple approach has proven effective for many students in mastering these major circulatory patterns. Another
approach that works well for many students is to create simple line drawings similar to the ones provided, labeling each of
the major vessels. It is beyond the scope of this text to name every vessel in the body. However, we will attempt to discuss
the major pathways for blood and acquaint you with the major named arteries and veins in the body. Also, please keep in
mind that individual variations in circulation patterns are not uncommon.

Pulmonary Circulation

Recall that blood returning from the systemic circuit enters the right atrium (Figure 20.23) via the superior and inferior
venae cavae and the coronary sinus, which drains the blood supply of the heart muscle. These vessels will be described
more fully later in this section. This blood is relatively low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon dioxide, since much of
the oxygen has been extracted for use by the tissues and the waste gas carbon dioxide was picked up to be transported to
the lungs for elimination. From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for gas
exchange. This system of vessels is referred to as the pulmonary circuit.

The single vessel exiting the right ventricle is the pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the
pulmonary semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole. As the
pulmonary trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides) into two
branches, a left and a right pulmonary artery. To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important to refer to the
vessel exiting the heart as the pulmonary trunk, rather than also calling it a pulmonary artery. The pulmonary arteries in turn
branch many times within the lung, forming a series of smaller arteries and arterioles that eventually lead to the pulmonary
capillaries. The pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli that are the sites of oxygen and carbon
dioxide exchange.

Once gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary
venules that eventually lead to a series of larger pulmonary veins. Four pulmonary veins, two on the left and two on the
right, return blood to the left atrium. At this point, the pulmonary circuit is complete. Table 20.4 defines the major arteries
and veins of the pulmonary circuit discussed in the text.

its branches—the systemic arteries—send blood to virtually every organ of the body (Figure 20.24).

Figure 20.24 Systemic Arteries The major systemic arteries shown here deliver oxygenated blood throughout the
body.

The Aorta

The aorta is the largest artery in the body (Figure 20.25). It arises from the left ventricle and eventually descends to
the abdominal region, where it bifurcates at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries.
The aorta consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta, which passes through the diaphragm
and a landmark that divides into the superior thoracic and inferior abdominal components. Arteries originating from the
aorta ultimately distribute blood to virtually all tissues of the body. At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve
that prevents backflow of blood into the left ventricle while the heart is relaxing. After exiting the heart, the ascending
aorta moves in a superior direction for approximately 5 cm and ends at the sternal angle. Following this ascent, it reverses
direction, forming a graceful arc to the left, called the aortic arch. The aortic arch descends toward the inferior portions of
the body and ends at the level of the intervertebral disk between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae. Beyond this point,
the descending aorta continues close to the bodies of the vertebrae and passes through an opening in the diaphragm known
as the aortic hiatus. Superior to the diaphragm, the aorta is called the thoracic aorta, and inferior to the diaphragm, it is
called the abdominal aorta. The abdominal aorta terminates when it bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries at the

Coronary Circulation

The first vessels that branch from the ascending aorta are the paired coronary arteries (see Figure 20.25), which arise from
two of the three sinuses in the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve. These sinuses contain the aortic
baroreceptors and chemoreceptors critical to maintain cardiac function. The left coronary artery arises from the left posterior
aortic sinus. The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus. Normally, the right posterior aortic sinus does
not give rise to a vessel.

Each subclavian artery supplies

blood to the arms, chest, shoulders, back, and central nervous system. It then gives

rise to three major branches: the internal thoracic artery, the vertebral artery, and the thyrocervical artery. The internal

he vertebral foramen in the cervical vertebrae and then through the foramen magnum

into the cranial cavity to supply blood to the brain and spinal cord. The paired vertebral arteries join together to form the
large basilar artery at the base of the medulla oblongata. This is an example of an anastomosis. The subclavian artery also
gives rise to the thyrocervical artery that provides blood to the thyroid, the cervical region of the neck, and the upper back
and shoulder.

The common carotid artery divides into internal and external carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery arises
from the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery arises directly from the aortic arch. The external carotid
artery supplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx. These branches
include the lingual, facial, occipital, maxillary, and superficial temporal arteries. The internal carotid artery initially forms
an expansion known as the carotid sinus, containing the carotid baroreceptors and chemoreceptors. Like their counterparts
in the aortic sinuses, the information provided by these receptors is critical to maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (see
Figure 20.23).

The internal carotid arteries along with the vertebral arteries are the two primary suppliers of blood to the human
brain. Given the central role and vital importance of the brain to life, it is critical that blood supply to this organ remains
uninterrupted. Recall that blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant, with approximately 20 percent of blood flow
directed to this organ at any given time. When blood flow is interrupted, even for just a few seconds, a transient ischemic
attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, may occur, resulting in loss of consciousness or temporary loss of neurological function. In
some cases, the damage may be permanent. Loss of blood flow for longer periods, typically between 3 and 4 minutes,
will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The locations
of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also prevent interruption in the flow of
blood. Both the carotid and vertebral arteries branch once they enter the cranial cavity, and some of these branches form a
structure known as the arterial circle (or circle of Willis), an anastomosis that is remarkably like a traffic circle that sends
off branches (in this case, arterial branches to the brain). As a rule, branches to the anterior portion of the cerebrum are
normally fed by the internal carotid arteries; the remainder of the brain receives blood flow from branches associated with
the vertebral arteries.

The internal carotid artery continues through the carotid canal of the temporal bone and enters the base of the brain
through the carotid foramen where it gives rise to several branches (Figure 20.26 and Figure 20.27). One of these branches
is the anterior cerebral artery that supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Another branch, the middle cerebral
artery, supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are the most common sites of CVAs. The ophthalmic
artery, the third major branch, provides blood to the eyes.

The right and left anterior cerebral arteries join together to form an anastomosis called the anterior communicating
artery. The initial segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery form the anterior portion
of the arterial circle. The posterior portion of the arterial circle is formed by a left and a right posterior communicating
artery that branches from the posterior cerebral artery, which arises from the basilar artery. It provides blood to the
posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem. The basilar artery is an anastomosis that begins at the junction of the two
vertebral arteries and sends branches to the cerebellum and brain stem. It flows into the posterior cerebral arteries. Table
20.6 summarizes the aortic arch branches, including the major branches supplying the brain.

Thoracic Aorta and Major Branches

The thoracic aorta begins at the level of vertebra T5 and continues through to the diaphragm at the level of T12, initially
traveling within the mediastinum to the left of the vertebral column. As it passes through the thoracic region, the thoracic
aorta gives rise to several branches, which are collectively referred to as visceral branches and parietal branches (Figure
20.28). Those branches that supply blood primarily to visceral organs are known as the visceral branches and include
the bronchial arteries, pericardial arteries, esophageal arteries, and the mediastinal arteries, each named after the tissues
it supplies. Each bronchial artery (typically two on the left and one on the right) supplies systemic blood to the lungs

879

880 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

and visceral pleura, in addition to the blood pumped to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary circuit. The bronchial
arteries follow the same path as the respiratory branches, beginning with the bronchi and ending with the bronchioles. There
is considerable, but not total, intermingling of the systemic and pulmonary blood at anastomoses in the smaller branches of
the lungs. This may sound incongruous—that is, the mixing of systemic arterial blood high in oxygen with the pulmonary
arterial blood lower in oxygen—but the systemic vessels also deliver nutrients to the lung tissue just as they do elsewhere
in the body. The mixed blood drains into typical pulmonary veins, whereas the bronchial artery branches remain separate
and drain into bronchial veins described later. Each pericardial artery supplies blood to the pericardium, the esophageal
artery provides blood to the esophagus, and the mediastinal artery provides blood to the mediastinum. The remaining
thoracic aorta branches are collectively referred to as parietal branches or somatic branches, and include the intercostal
and superior phrenic arteries. Each intercostal artery provides blood to the muscles of the thoracic cavity and vertebral

column. The superior phrenic artery provides blood to the superior surface of the diaphragm. Table 20.7 lists the arteries
of the thoracic region.

Abdominal Aorta and Major Branches

After crossing through the diaphragm at the aortic hiatus, the thoracic aorta is called the abdominal aorta (see Figure 20.28).
This vessel remains to the left of the vertebral column and is embedded in adipose tissue behind the peritoneal cavity. It
formally ends at approximately the level of vertebra L4, where it bifurcates to form the common iliac arteries. Before this
division, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several important branches. A single celiac trunk (artery) emerges and divides
into the left gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach and esophagus, the splenic artery to supply blood to the spleen,
and the common hepatic artery, which in turn gives rise to the hepatic artery proper to supply blood to the liver, the
right gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach, the cystic artery to supply blood to the gall bladder, and several
branches, one to supply blood to the duodenum and another to supply blood to the pancreas. Two additional single vessels
arise from the abdominal aorta. These are the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The superior mesenteric artery
arises approximately 2.5 cm after the celiac trunk and branches into several major vessels that supply blood to the small
intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine. The inferior mesenteric
artery supplies blood to the distal segment of the large intestine, including the rectum. It arises approximately 5 cm superior
to the common iliac arteries.

In addition to these single branches, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several significant paired arteries along the
way. These include the inferior phrenic arteries, the adrenal arteries, the renal arteries, the gonadal arteries, and the lumbar
arteries. Each inferior phrenic artery is a counterpart of a superior phrenic artery and supplies blood to the inferior
surface of the diaphragm. The adrenal artery supplies blood to the adrenal (suprarenal) glands and arises near the superior
mesenteric artery. Each renal artery branches approximately 2.5 cm inferior to the superior mesenteric arteries and supplies
a kidney. The right renal artery is longer than the left since the aorta lies to the left of the vertebral column and the vesse!
must travel a greater distance to reach its target. Renal arteries branch repeatedly to supply blood to the kidneys. Each
gonadal artery supplies blood to the gonads, or reproductive organs, and is also described as either an ovarian artery or
a testicular artery (internal spermatic), depending upon the sex of the individual. An ovarian artery supplies blood to an
ovary, uterine (Fallopian) tube, and the uterus, and is located within the suspensory ligament of the uterus. It is considerably
shorter than a testicular artery, which ultimately travels outside the body cavity to the testes, forming one component o
the spermatic cord. The gonadal arteries arise inferior to the renal arteries and are generally retroperitoneal. The ovarian
artery continues to the uterus where it forms an anastomosis with the uterine artery that supplies blood to the uterus. Both the
uterine arteries and vaginal arteries, which distribute blood to the vagina, are branches of the internal iliac artery. The four
paired lumbar arteries are the counterparts of the intercostal arteries and supply blood to the lumbar region, the abdomina
wall, and the spinal cord. In some instances, a fifth pair of lumbar arteries emerges from the median sacral artery.

The aorta divides at approximately the level of vertebra L4 into a left and a right common iliac artery but continues as
a small vessel, the median sacral artery, into the sacrum. The common iliac arteries provide blood to the pelvic region and
ultimately to the lower limbs. They split into external and internal iliac arteries approximately at the level of the lumbar-
sacral articulation. Each internal iliac artery sends branches to the urinary bladder, the walls of the pelvis, the external
genitalia, and the medial portion of the femoral region. In females, they also provide blood to the uterus and vagina. The
much larger external iliac artery supplies blood to each of the lower limbs. Figure 20.29 shows the distribution of the
major branches of the aorta into the thoracic and abdominal regions. Figure 20.30 shows the distribution of the major
branches of the common iliac arteries. Table 20.8 summarizes the major branches of the abdominal aorta.

Arteries Serving the Upper Limbs

As the subclavian artery exits the thorax into the axillary region, it is renamed the axillary artery. Although it does branch
and supply blood to the region near the head of the humerus (via the humeral circumflex arteries), the majority of the
vessel continues into the upper arm, or brachium, and becomes the brachial artery (Figure 20.31). The brachial artery
supplies blood to much of the brachial region and divides at the elbow into several smaller branches, including the deep
brachial arteries, which provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm, and the ulnar collateral arteries, which supply
blood to the region of the elbow. As the brachial artery approaches the coronoid fossa, it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar
arteries, which continue into the forearm, or antebrachium. The radial artery and ulnar artery parallel their namesake
bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region. At this level, they fuse to form the superficial
and deep palmar arches that supply blood to the hand, as well as the digital arteries that supply blood to the digits. Figure
20.32 shows the distribution of systemic arteries from the heart into the upper limb. Table 20.9 summarizes the arteries
serving the upper limbs.

CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION 887

Arteries Serving the Lower Limbs

The external iliac artery exits the body cavity and enters the femoral region of the lower leg (Figure 20.33). As it passes
through the body wall, it is renamed the femoral artery. It gives off several smaller branches as well as the lateral deep
femoral artery that in turn gives rise to a lateral circumflex artery. These arteries supply blood to the deep muscles of
the thigh as well as ventral and lateral regions of the integument. The femoral artery also gives rise to the genicular artery,
which provides blood to the region of the knee. As the femoral artery passes posterior to the knee near the popliteal fossa,
it is called the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.

The anterior tibial artery is located between the tibia and fibula, and supplies blood to the muscles and integument of
the anterior tibial region. Upon reaching the tarsal region, it becomes the dorsalis pedis artery, which branches repeatedly
and provides blood to the tarsal and dorsal regions of the foot. The posterior tibial artery provides blood to the muscles
and integument on the posterior surface of the tibial region. The fibular or peroneal artery branches from the posterior tibial
artery. It bifurcates and becomes the medial plantar artery and lateral plantar artery, providing blood to the plantar
surfaces. There is an anastomosis with the dorsalis pedis artery, and the medial and lateral plantar arteries form two arches
called the dorsal arch (also called the arcuate arch) and the plantar arch, which provide blood to the remainder of the foot
and toes. Figure 20.34 shows the distribution of the major systemic arteries in the lower limb. Table 20.10 summarizes the
major systemic arteries discussed in the text.

Overview of Systemic Veins

Systemic veins return blood to the right atrium. Since the blood has already passed through the systemic capillaries, it will
be relatively low in oxygen concentration. In many cases, there will be veins draining organs and regions of the body with
the same name as the arteries that supplied these regions and the two often parallel one another. This is often described as
a “complementary” pattern. However, there is a great deal more variability in the venous circulation than normally occurs
in the arteries. For the sake of brevity and clarity, this text will discuss only the most commonly encountered patterns.
However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to clinical practice.

In both the neck and limb regions, there are often both superficial and deeper levels of veins. The deeper veins
generally correspond to the complementary arteries. The superficial veins do not normally have direct arterial counterparts,
but in addition to returning blood, they also make contributions to the maintenance of body temperature. When the ambient
temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can be more easily dissipated to the
environment. In colder weather, there is more constriction of the superficial veins and blood is diverted deeper where the
body can retain more of the heat.

The “Voyage of Discovery” analogy and stick drawings mentioned earlier remain valid techniques for the study of
systemic veins, but veins present a more difficult challenge because there are numerous anastomoses and multiple branches.
It is like following a river with many tributaries and channels, several of which interconnect. Tracing blood flow through
arteries follows the current in the direction of blood flow, so that we move from the heart through the large arteries and into
the smaller arteries to the capillaries. From the capillaries, we move into the smallest veins and follow the direction of blood
flow into larger veins and back to the heart. Figure 20.35 outlines the path of the major systemic veins.

Figure 20.35 Major Systemic Veins of the Body The major systemic veins of the body are shown here in an anterior
view.

The right atrium receives all of the systemic venous return. Most of the blood flows into either the superior vena cava
or inferior vena cava. If you draw an imaginary line at the level of the diaphragm, systemic venous circulation from above
that line will generally flow into the superior vena cava; this includes blood from the head, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper
limbs. The exception to this is that most venous blood flow from the coronary veins flows directly into the coronary sinus
and from there directly into the right atrium. Beneath the diaphragm, systemic venous flow enters the inferior vena cava,
that is, blood from the abdominal and pelvic regions and the lower limbs.

The Superior Vena Cava

The superior vena cava drains most of the body superior to the diaphragm (Figure 20.36). On both the left and right sides,
the subclavian vein forms when the axillary vein passes through the body wall from the axillary region. It fuses with the
external and internal jugular veins from the head and neck to form the brachiocephalic vein. Each vertebral vein also
flows into the brachiocephalic vein close to this fusion. These veins arise from the base of the brain and the cervical region

of the spinal cord, and flow largely through the intervertebral foramina in the cervical vertebrae. They are the counterparts
of the vertebral arteries. Each internal thoracic vein, also known as an internal mammary vein, drains the anterior surface
of the chest wall and flows into the brachiocephalic vein.

The remainder of the blood supply from the thorax drains into the azygos vein. Each intercostal vein drains muscles
of the thoracic wall, each esophageal vein delivers blood from the inferior portions of the esophagus, each bronchial vein
drains the systemic circulation from the lungs, and several smaller veins drain the mediastinal region. Bronchial veins carry
approximately 13 percent of the blood that flows into the bronchial arteries; the remainder intermingles with the pulmonary
circulation and returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins. These veins flow into the azygos vein, and with the smaller
hemiazygos vein (hemi- = “half”) on the left of the vertebral column, drain blood from the thoracic region. The hemiazygos
vein does not drain directly into the superior vena cava but enters the brachiocephalic vein via the superior intercostal vein.

The azygos vein passes through the diaphragm from the thoracic cavity on the right side of the vertebral column and
begins in the lumbar region of the thoracic cavity. It flows into the superior vena cava at approximately the level of T2,
making a significant contribution to the flow of blood. It combines with the two large left and right brachiocephalic veins
to form the superior vena cava.

Veins of the Head and Neck

Blood from the brain and the superficial facial vein flow into each internal jugular vein (Figure 20.37). Blood from the
more superficial portions of the head, scalp, and cranial regions, including the temporal vein and maxillary vein, flow into
each external jugular vein. Although the external and internal jugular veins are separate vessels, there are anastomoses
between them close to the thoracic region. Blood from the external jugular vein empties into the subclavian vein. Table

Venous Drainage of the Brain

Circulation to the brain is both critical and complex (see Figure 20.37). Many smaller veins of the brain stem and the
superficial veins of the cerebrum lead to larger vessels referred to as intracranial sinuses. These include the superior and
inferior sagittal sinuses, straight sinus, cavernous sinuses, left and right sinuses, the petrosal sinuses, and the occipital
sinuses. Ultimately, sinuses will lead back to either the inferior jugular vein or vertebral vein.

Most of the veins on the superior surface of the cerebrum flow into the largest of the sinuses, the superior sagittal
sinus. It is located midsagittally between the meningeal and periosteal layers of the dura mater within the falx cerebri and,
at first glance in images or models, can be mistaken for the subarachnoid space. Most reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid

occurs via the chorionic villi (arachnoid granulations) into the superior sagittal sinus. Blood from most of the smaller vessels
originating from the inferior cerebral veins flows into the great cerebral vein and into the straight sinus. Other cerebral
veins and those from the eye socket flow into the cavernous sinus, which flows into the petrosal sinus and then into
the internal jugular vein. The occipital sinus, sagittal sinus, and straight sinuses all flow into the left and right transverse
sinuses near the lambdoid suture. The transverse sinuses in turn flow into the sigmoid sinuses that pass through the jugular
foramen and into the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein flows parallel to the common carotid artery and is
more or less its counterpart. It empties into the brachiocephalic vein. The veins draining the cervical vertebrae and the
posterior surface of the skull, including some blood from the occipital sinus, flow into the vertebral veins. These parallel
the vertebral arteries and travel through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral veins also flow into
the brachiocephalic veins. Table 20.13 summarizes the major veins of the brain.

Veins Draining the Upper Limbs

The digital veins in the fingers come together in the hand to form the palmar venous arches (Figure 20.38). From here,
the veins come together to form the radial vein, the ulnar vein, and the median antebrachial vein. The radial vein and the
ulnar vein parallel the bones of the forearm and join together at the antebrachium to form the brachial vein, a deep vein
that flows into the axillary vein in the brachium.

The median antebrachial vein parallels the ulnar vein, is more medial in location, and joins the basilic vein in the
forearm. As the basilic vein reaches the antecubital region, it gives off a branch called the median cubital vein that crosses
at an angle to join the cephalic vein. The median cubital vein is the most common site for drawing venous blood in humans.
The basilic vein continues through the arm medially and superficially to the axillary vein.

The cephalic vein begins in the antebrachium and drains blood from the superficial surface of the arm into the axillary
vein. It is extremely superficial and easily seen along the surface of the biceps brachii muscle in individuals with good
muscle tone and in those without excessive subcutaneous adipose tissue in the arms.

The subscapular vein drains blood from the subscapular region and joins the cephalic vein to form the axillary vein.
As it passes through the body wall and enters the thorax, the axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein.

Many of the larger veins of the thoracic and abdominal region and upper limb are further represented in the flow chart
in Figure 20.39. Table 20.14 summarizes the veins of the upper limbs.

The Inferior Vena Cava

Other than the small amount of blood drained by the azygos and hemiazygos veins, most of the blood inferior to the
diaphragm drains into the inferior vena cava before it is returned to the heart (see Figure 20.36). Lying just beneath the
parietal peritoneum in the abdominal cavity, the inferior vena cava parallels the abdominal aorta, where it can receive

blood
veins.

from abdominal veins. The lumbar portions of the abdominal wall and spinal cord are drained by a series of lumbar
, usually four on each side. The ascending lumbar veins drain into either the azygos vein on the right or the hemiazygos

vein on the left, and return to the superior vena cava. The remaining lumbar veins drain directly into the inferior vena cava.

Blood supply from the kidneys flows into each renal vein, normally the largest veins entering the inferior vena cava.

A number of other, smaller veins empty into the left renal vein. Each adrenal vein drains the adrenal or suprarenal glands
located immediately superior to the kidneys. The right adrenal vein enters the inferior vena cava directly, whereas the left

adrenal vein enters the left renal vein.

Each side of the diaphragm drains into a phrenic vein; the right phrenic vein empties directly into the inferior vena
whereas the left phrenic vein empties into the left renal vein. Blood supply from the liver drains into each hepatic

Veins Draining the Lower Limbs

The superior surface of the foot drains into the digital veins, and the inferior surface drains into the plantar veins, which
‘low into a complex series of anastomoses in the feet and ankles, including the dorsal venous arch and the plantar venous
arch (Figure 20.41). From the dorsal venous arch, blood supply drains into the anterior and posterior tibial veins. The
anterior tibial vein drains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and combines with the posterior tibial vein and the
‘ibular vein to form the popliteal vein. The posterior tibial vein drains the posterior surface of the tibia and joins the
popliteal vein. The fibular vein drains the muscles and integument in proximity to the fibula and also joins the popliteal
vein. The small saphenous vein located on the lateral surface of the leg drains blood from the superficial regions of the
lower leg and foot, and flows into to the popliteal vein. As the popliteal vein passes behind the knee in the popliteal region,
it becomes the femoral vein. It is palpable in patients without excessive adipose tissue.

Close to the body wall, the great saphenous vein, the deep femoral vein, and the femoral circumflex vein drain into the
emoral vein. The great saphenous vein is a prominent surface vessel located on the medial surface of the leg and thigh that
collects blood from the superficial portions of these areas. The deep femoral vein, as the name suggests, drains blood from
the deeper portions of the thigh. The femoral circumflex vein forms a loop around the femur just inferior to the trochanters
and drains blood from the areas in proximity to the head and neck of the femur.

As the femoral vein penetrates the body wall from the femoral portion of the upper limb, it becomes the external iliac
vein, a large vein that drains blood from the leg to the common iliac vein. The pelvic organs and integument drain into the
internal iliac vein, which forms from several smaller veins in the region, including the umbilical veins that run on either
side of the bladder. The external and internal iliac veins combine near the inferior portion of the sacroiliac joint to form the
common iliac vein. In addition to blood supply from the external and internal iliac veins, the middle sacral vein drains the
sacral region into the common iliac vein. Similar to the common iliac arteries, the common iliac veins come together at the
level of L5 to form the inferior vena cava.

Figure 20.42 is a flow chart of veins flowing into the lower limb. Table 20.16 summarizes the major veins of the lower

Hepatic Portal System

The liver is a complex biochemical processing plant. It packages nutrients absorbed by the digestive system; produces
plasma proteins, clotting factors, and bile; and disposes of worn-out cell components and waste products. Instead of entering
the circulation directly, absorbed nutrients and certain wastes (for example, materials produced by the spleen) travel to the
liver for processing. They do so via the hepatic portal system (Figure 20.43). Portal systems begin and end in capillaries.
In this case, the initial capillaries from the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and spleen lead to the hepatic portal
vein and end in specialized capillaries within the liver, the hepatic sinusoids. You saw the only other portal system with the
hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessel in the endocrine chapter.

The hepatic portal system consists of the hepatic portal vein and the veins that drain into it. The hepatic portal vein
itself is relatively short, beginning at the level of L2 with the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. It also
receives branches from the inferior mesenteric vein, plus the splenic veins and all their tributaries. The superior mesenteric
vein receives blood from the small intestine, two-thirds of the large intestine, and the stomach. The inferior mesenteric vein
drains the distal third of the large intestine, including the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. The splenic
vein is formed from branches from the spleen, pancreas, and portions of the stomach, and the inferior mesenteric vein. After
its formation, the hepatic portal vein also receives branches from the gastric veins of the stomach and cystic veins from the
gall bladder. The hepatic portal vein delivers materials from these digestive and circulatory organs directly to the liver for
processing.

Because of the hepatic portal system, the liver receives its blood supply from two different sources: from normal
systemic circulation via the hepatic artery and from the hepatic portal vein. The liver processes the blood from the portal
system to remove certain wastes and excess nutrients, which are stored for later use. This processed blood, as well as the
systemic blood that came from the hepatic artery, exits the liver via the right, left, and middle hepatic veins, and flows into
the inferior vena cava. Overall systemic blood composition remains relatively stable, since the liver is able to metabolize
the absorbed digestive components.

blood exits the liver via the hepatic vein, which delivers the blood to the inferior vena cava. (Different colors are used
to help distinguish among the different vessels in the system.)

20.6 | Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
* Describe the development of blood vessels

¢ Describe the fetal circulation

In a developing embryo,the heart has developed enough by day 21 post-fertilization to begin beating. Circulation patterns
are clearly established by the fourth week of embryonic life. It is critical to the survival of the developing human that
the circulatory system forms early to supply the growing tissue with nutrients and gases, and to remove waste products.
Blood cells and vessel production in structures outside the embryo proper called the yolk sac, chorion, and connecting stalk
begin about 15 to 16 days following fertilization. Development of these circulatory elements within the embryo itself begins
approximately 2 days later. You will learn more about the formation and function of these early structures when you study
the chapter on development. During those first few weeks, blood vessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm. The
precursor cells are known as hemangioblasts. These in turn differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood
vessels and pluripotent stem cells, which differentiate into the formed elements of blood. (Seek additional content for more
detail on fetal development and circulation.) Together, these cells form masses known as blood islands scattered throughout
the embryonic disc. Spaces appear on the blood islands that develop into vessel lumens. The endothelial lining of the
vessels arise from the angioblasts within these islands. Surrounding mesenchymal cells give rise to the smooth muscle and
connective tissue layers of the vessels. While the vessels are developing, the pluripotent stem cells begin to form the blood.

Vascular tubes also develop on the blood islands, and they eventually connect to one another as well as to the
developing, tubular heart. Thus, the developmental pattern, rather than beginning from the formation of one central vessel
and spreading outward, occurs in many regions simultaneously with vessels later joining together. This angiogenesis—the
creation of new blood vessels from existing ones—continues as needed throughout life as we grow and develop.

Blood vessel development often follows the same pattern as nerve development and travels to the same target tissues
and organs. This occurs because the many factors directing growth of nerves also stimulate blood vessels to follow a
similar pattern. Whether a given vessel develops into an artery or a vein is dependent upon local concentrations of signaling
proteins.

As the embryo grows within the mother’s uterus, its requirements for nutrients and gas exchange also grow. The
placenta—a circulatory organ unique to pregnancy—develops jointly from the embryo and uterine wall structures to fill
this need. Emerging from the placenta is the umbilical vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the
fetal inferior vena cava via the ductus venosus to the heart that pumps it into fetal circulation. Two umbilical arteries
carry oxygen-depleted fetal blood, including wastes and carbon dioxide, to the placenta. Remnants of the umbilical arteries
remain in the adult. (Seek additional content for more information on the role of the placenta in fetal circulation.)


904 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

There are three major shunts—alternate paths for blood flow—found in the circulatory system of the fetus. Two of
these shunts divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, whereas the third connects the umbilical vein to the
inferior vena cava. The first two shunts are critical during fetal life, when the lungs are compressed, filled with amniotic
fluid, and nonfunctional, and gas exchange is provided by the placenta. These shunts close shortly after birth, however,
when the newborn begins to breathe. The third shunt persists a bit longer but becomes nonfunctional once the umbilical
cord is severed. The three shunts are as follows (Figure 20.44):

¢ The foramen ovale is an opening in the interatrial septum that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left
atrium. A valve associated with this opening prevents backflow of blood during the fetal period. As the newborn begins
to breathe and blood pressure in the atria increases, this shunt closes. The fossa ovalis remains in the interatrial septum
after birth, marking the location of the former foramen ovale.

¢ The ductus arteriosus is a short, muscular vessel that connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. Most of the blood
pumped from the right ventricle into the pulmonary trunk is thereby diverted into the aorta. Only enough blood reaches
the fetal lungs to maintain the developing lung tissue. When the newborn takes the first breath, pressure within the
lungs drops dramatically, and both the lungs and the pulmonary vessels expand. As the amount of oxygen increases,
the smooth muscles in the wall of the ductus arteriosus constrict, sealing off the passage. Eventually, the muscular
and endothelial components of the ductus arteriosus degenerate, leaving only the connective tissue component of the
ligamentum arteriosum.

* The ductus venosus is a temporary blood vessel that branches from the umbilical vein, allowing much of the freshly
oxygenated blood from the placenta—the organ of gas exchange between the mother and fetus—to bypass the fetal
liver and go directly to the fetal heart. The ductus venosus closes slowly during the first weeks of infancy and
degenerates to become the ligamentum venosum.

CHAPTER REVIEW

20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels

Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins
before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming

914 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION

arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to
small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart.

The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls that appear round in cross section.
The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often
appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica
media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple
squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media is a thicker area
composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries.
The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood
flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.

20.2 Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance

Blood flow is the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ. The slowing or blocking of blood flow is called
resistance. Blood pressure is the force that blood exerts upon the walls of the blood vessels or chambers of the heart. The
components of blood pressure include systolic pressure, which results from ventricular contraction, and diastolic pressure,
which results from ventricular relaxation. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic measures, and
mean arterial pressure is the “average” pressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood into the tissues. Pulse, the
expansion and recoiling of an artery, reflects the heartbeat. The variables affecting blood flow and blood pressure in the
systemic circulation are cardiac output, compliance, blood volume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of the
blood vessels. In the arterial system, vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant factor in systemic
blood pressure: Slight vasodilation greatly decreases resistance and increases flow, whereas slight vasoconstriction greatly
increases resistance and decreases flow. In the arterial system, as resistance increases, blood pressure increases and flow
decreases. In the venous system, constriction increases blood pressure as it does in arteries; the increasing pressure helps to
return blood to the heart. In addition, constriction causes the vessel lumen to become more rounded, decreasing resistance
and increasing blood flow. Venoconstriction, while less important than arterial vasoconstriction, works with the skeletal
muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and their valves to promote venous return to the heart.

20.3 Capillary Exchange

Small molecules can cross into and out of capillaries via simple or facilitated diffusion. Some large molecules can cross
in vesicles or through clefts, fenestrations, or gaps between cells in capillary walls. However, the bulk flow of capillary
and tissue fluid occurs via filtration and reabsorption. Filtration, the movement of fluid out of the capillaries, is driven by
the CHP. Reabsorption, the influx of tissue fluid into the capillaries, is driven by the BCOP. Filtration predominates in the
arterial end of the capillary; in the middle section, the opposing pressures are virtually identical so there is no net exchange,
whereas reabsorption predominates at the venule end of the capillary. The hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures in the
interstitial fluid are negligible in healthy circumstances.

20.4 Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System

Neural, endocrine, and autoregulatory mechanisms affect blood flow, blood pressure, and eventually perfusion of blood to
body tissues. Neural mechanisms include the cardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata, baroreceptors in the aorta
and carotid arteries and right atrium, and associated chemoreceptors that monitor blood levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen ions. Endocrine controls include epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as ADH, the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone mechanism, ANH, and EPO. Autoregulation is the local control of vasodilation and constriction by chemical
signals and the myogenic response. Exercise greatly improves cardiovascular function and reduces the risk of cardiovascular
diseases, including hypertension, a leading cause of heart attacks and strokes. Significant hemorrhage can lead to a form
of circulatory shock known as hypovolemic shock. Sepsis, obstruction, and widespread inflammation can also cause
circulatory shock.

20.5 Circulatory Pathways

The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries, which
carry it to the right and left lungs for gas exchange. Oxygen-rich blood is transported by pulmonary veins to the left atrium.
The left ventricle pumps this blood into the aorta. The main regions of the aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch,
and descending aorta, which is further divided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The coronary arteries branch from
the ascending aorta. After oxygenating tissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to the right atrium from the
venous system via the superior vena cava, which drains most of the veins superior to the diaphragm, the inferior vena cava,
which drains most of the veins inferior to the diaphragm, and the coronary veins via the coronary sinus. The hepatic portal
system carries blood to the liver for processing before it enters circulation. Review the figures provided in this section for
circulation of blood through the blood vessels.

20.6 Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation

Blood vessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm. The precursor hemangioblasts differentiate into angioblasts,
which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells that differentiate into the formed elements of the blood.
Together, these cells form blood islands scattered throughout the embryo. Extensions known as vascular tubes eventually
connect the vascular network. As the embryo grows within the mother’s womb, the placenta develops to supply blood rich
in oxygen and nutrients via the umbilical vein and to remove wastes in oxygen-depleted blood via the umbilical arteries.
Three major shunts found in the fetus are the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which divert blood from the pulmonary
to the systemic circuit, and the ductus venosus, which carries freshly oxygenated blood high in nutrients to the fetal heart.

Introduction

Chapter Objectives

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:

* Identify the components and anatomy of the lymphatic system


920 CHAPTER 21| THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

* Discuss the role of the innate immune response against pathogens

* Describe the power of the adaptive immune response to cure disease

¢ Explain immunological deficiencies and over-reactions of the immune system

* Discuss the role of the immune response in transplantation and cancer

* Describe the interaction of the immune and lymphatic systems with other body systems

In June 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, published a report of an unusual
cluster of five patients in Los Angeles, California. All five were diagnosed with a rare pneumonia caused by a fungus called
Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii).

Why was this unusual? Although commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals, this fungus is an opportunistic
pathogen that causes disease in individuals with suppressed or underdeveloped immune systems. The very young, whose
immune systems have yet to mature, and the elderly, whose immune systems have declined with age, are particularly
susceptible. The five patients from LA, though, were between 29 and 36 years of age and should have been in the prime o
their lives, immunologically speaking. What could be going on?

A few days later, a cluster of eight cases was reported in New York City, also involving young patients, this time
exhibiting a rare form of skin cancer known as Kaposi’s sarcoma. This cancer of the cells that line the blood and lymphatic
vessels was previously observed as a relatively innocuous disease of the elderly. The disease that doctors saw in 1981 was
frighteningly more severe, with multiple, fast-growing lesions that spread to all parts of the body, including the trunk and
face. Could the immune systems of these young patients have been compromised in some way? Indeed, when they were
tested, they exhibited extremely low numbers of a specific type of white blood cell in their bloodstreams, indicating that
they had somehow lost a major part of the immune system.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, turned out to be a new disease caused by the previously unknown
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although nearly 100 percent fatal in those with active HIV infections in the early
years, the development of anti-HIV drugs has transformed HIV infection into a chronic, manageable disease and not the
certain death sentence it once was. One positive outcome resulting from the emergence of HIV disease was that the public’s
attention became focused as never before on the importance of having a functional and healthy immune system.

21.1 | Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the structure and function of the lymphatic tissue (lymph fluid, vessels, ducts, and organs)
¢ Describe the structure and function of the primary and secondary lymphatic organs

* Discuss the cells of the immune system, how they function, and their relationship with the lymphatic system

The immune system is the complex collection of cells and organs that destroys or neutralizes pathogens that would
otherwise cause disease or death. The lymphatic system, for most people, is associated with the immune system to such a
degree that the two systems are virtually indistinguishable. The lymphatic system is the system of vessels, cells, and organs
that carries excess fluids to the bloodstream and filters pathogens from the blood. The swelling of lymph nodes during an
infection and the transport of lymphocytes via the lymphatic vessels are but two examples of the many connections between
these critical organ systems.

Functions of the Lymphatic System

A major function of the lymphatic system is to drain body fluids and return them to the bloodstream. Blood pressure causes
leakage of fluid from the capillaries, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space—that is, spaces between
individual cells in the tissues. In humans, 20 liters of plasma is released into the interstitial space of the tissues each day
due to capillary filtration. Once this filtrate is out of the bloodstream and in the tissue spaces, it is referred to as interstitial
fluid. Of this, 17 liters is reabsorbed directly by the blood vessels. But what happens to the remaining three liters? This
is where the lymphatic system comes into play. It drains the excess fluid and empties it back into the bloodstream via a
series of vessels, trunks, and ducts. Lymph is the term used to describe interstitial fluid once it has entered the lymphatic
system. When the lymphatic system is damaged in some way, such as by being blocked by cancer cells or destroyed by
injury, protein-rich interstitial fluid accumulates (sometimes “backs up” from the lymph vessels) in the tissue spaces. This
inappropriate accumulation of fluid referred to as lymphedema may lead to serious medical consequences.

As the vertebrate immune system evolved, the network of lymphatic vessels became convenient avenues for
transporting the cells of the immune system. Additionally, the transport of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins absorbed
in the gut uses this system.

Cells of the immune system not only use lymphatic vessels to make their way from interstitial spaces back into the
circulation, but they also use lymph nodes as major staging areas for the development of critical immune responses. A
lymph node is one of the small, bean-shaped organs located throughout the lymphatic system.

Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lymphsystem) for an overview of the lymphatic system. What are the
three main components of the lymphatic system?

Structure of the Lymphatic System

The lymphatic vessels begin as open-ended capillaries, which feed into larger and larger lymphatic vessels, and eventually
empty into the bloodstream by a series of ducts. Along the way, the lymph travels through the lymph nodes, which are
commonly found near the groin, armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen. Humans have about 500-600 lymph nodes throughout
the body (Figure 21.2).

Figure 21.2 Anatomy of the Lymphatic System Lymphatic vessels in the arms and legs convey lymph to the larger
lymphatic vessels in the torso.

A major distinction between the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems in humans is that lymph is not actively pumped
by the heart, but is forced through the vessels by the movements of the body, the contraction of skeletal muscles during
body movements, and breathing. One-way valves (semi-lunar valves) in lymphatic vessels keep the lymph moving toward

922 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

the heart. Lymph flows from the lymphatic capillaries, through lymphatic vessels, and then is dumped into the circulatory
system via the lymphatic ducts located at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck.
Lymphatic Capillaries

Lymphatic capillaries, also called the terminal lymphatics, are vessels where interstitial fluid enters the lymphatic system
to become lymph fluid. Located in almost every tissue in the body, these vessels are interlaced among the arterioles and
venules of the circulatory system in the soft connective tissues of the body (Figure 21.3). Exceptions are the central nervous
system, bone marrow, bones, teeth, and the cornea of the eye, which do not contain lymph vessels.

Figure 21.3 Lymphatic Capillaries Lymphatic capillaries are interlaced with the arterioles and venules of the
cardiovascular system. Collagen fibers anchor a lymphatic capillary in the tissue (inset). Interstitial fluid slips through
spaces between the overlapping endothelial cells that compose the lymphatic capillary.

Lymphatic capillaries are formed by a one cell-thick layer of endothelial cells and represent the open end of the
system, allowing interstitial fluid to flow into them via overlapping cells (see Figure 21.3). When interstitial pressure is
low, the endothelial flaps close to prevent “backflow.” As interstitial pressure increases, the spaces between the cells open
up, allowing the fluid to enter. Entry of fluid into lymphatic capillaries is also enabled by the collagen filaments that anchor
the capillaries to surrounding structures. As interstitial pressure increases, the filaments pull on the endothelial cell flaps,
opening up them even further to allow easy entry of fluid.

In the small intestine, lymphatic capillaries called lacteals are critical for the transport of dietary lipids and lipid-soluble
vitamins to the bloodstream. In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides combine with other lipids and proteins, and enter
the lacteals to form a milky fluid called chyle. The chyle then travels through the lymphatic system, eventually entering the
liver and then the bloodstream.

Larger Lymphatic Vessels, Trunks, and Ducts

The lymphatic capillaries empty into larger lymphatic vessels, which are similar to veins in terms of their three-tunic
structure and the presence of valves. These one-way valves are located fairly close to one another, and each one causes a
bulge in the lymphatic vessel, giving the vessels a beaded appearance (see Figure 21.3).

The superficial and deep lymphatics eventually merge to form larger lymphatic vessels known as lymphatic trunks.
On the right side of the body, the right sides of the head, thorax, and right upper limb drain lymph fluid into the right
subclavian vein via the right lymphatic duct (Figure 21.4). On the left side of the body, the remaining portions of the body
drain into the larger thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein. The thoracic duct itself begins just beneath the
diaphragm in the cisterna chyli, a sac-like chamber that receives lymph from the lower abdomen, pelvis, and lower limbs
by way of the left and right lumbar trunks and the intestinal trunk.

Figure 21.4 Major Trunks and Ducts of the Lymphatic System The thoracic duct drains a much larger portion of
the body than does the right lymphatic duct.

The overall drainage system of the body is asymmetrical (see Figure 21.4). The right lymphatic duct receives lymph
from only the upper right side of the body. The lymph from the rest of the body enters the bloodstream through the thoracic
duct via all the remaining lymphatic trunks. In general, lymphatic vessels of the subcutaneous tissues of the skin, that is, the
superficial lymphatics, follow the same routes as veins, whereas the deep lymphatic vessels of the viscera generally follow
the paths of arteries.

The Organization of Immune Function

The immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble proteins that interact and communicate with each other in
extraordinarily complex ways. The modern model of immune function is organized into three phases based on the timing of
their effects. The three temporal phases consist of the following:
¢ Barrier defenses such as the skin and mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic invasion
into the body tissues
¢ The rapid but nonspecific innate immune response, which consists of a variety of specialized cells and soluble factors
* The slower but more specific and effective adaptive immune response, which involves many cell types and soluble
factors, but is primarily controlled by white blood cells (leukocytes) known as lymphocytes, which help control
immune responses
The cells of the blood, including all those involved in the immune response, arise in the bone marrow via various
differentiation pathways from hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 21.5). In contrast with embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic
stem cells are present throughout adulthood and allow for the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost
to age or function. These cells can be divided into three classes based on function:
* Phagocytic cells, which ingest pathogens to destroy them
* Lymphocytes, which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive immunity
* Cells containing cytoplasmic granules, which help mediate immune responses against parasites and intracellular
pathogens such as viruses

As stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses (Table 21.1). The two basic types of
lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of
cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete.
While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both initially develop from bone marrow. T
cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts
of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and

lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section. The human body contains approximately 10! lymphocytes.
B Cells

B cells are immune cells that function primarily by producing antibodies. An antibody is any of the group of proteins that
binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens. An antigen is a chemical structure on the surface
of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors. Once activated by binding to antigen, B cells differentiate
into cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. These activated B cells are known as plasma cells.

T Cells

The T cell, on the other hand, does not secrete antibody but performs a variety of functions in the adaptive immune response.
Different T cell types have the ability to either secrete soluble factors that communicate with other cells of the adaptive
immune response or destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens. The roles of T and B lymphocytes in the adaptive
immune response will be discussed further in this chapter.

Plasma Cells

Another type of lymphocyte of importance is the plasma cell. A plasma cell is a B cell that has differentiated in response
to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies. These cells differ in morphology from
standard B and T cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm packed with the protein-synthesizing machinery
known as rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Natural Killer Cells

A fourth important lymphocyte is the natural killer cell, a participant in the innate immune response. A natural killer
cell (NK) is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm. It shares this
mechanism with the cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune response. NK cells are among the body’s first lines of defense
against viruses and certain types of cancer.

Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development

Understanding the differentiation and development of B and T cells is critical to the understanding of the adaptive immune
response. It is through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only pathogens and leaves the body’s own cells
relatively intact. The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are
where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack pathogens without harming the cells
of the body.

Bone Marrow

In the embryo, blood cells are made in the yolk sac. As development proceeds, this function is taken over by the spleen,
lymph nodes, and liver. Later, the bone marrow takes over most hematopoietic functions, although the final stages of the
differentiation of some cells may take place in other organs. The red bone marrow is a loose collection of cells where
hematopoiesis occurs, and the yellow bone marrow is a site of energy storage, which consists largely of fat cells (Figure
21.6). The B cell undergoes nearly all of its development in the red bone marrow, whereas the immature T cell, called a
thymocyte, leaves the bone marrow and matures largely in the thymus gland.

The connective tissue capsule further divides the thymus into lobules via extensions called trabeculae. The outer region
of the organ is known as the cortex and contains large numbers of thymocytes with some epithelial cells, macrophages, and
dendritic cells (two types of phagocytic cells that are derived from monocytes). The cortex is densely packed so it stains
more intensely than the rest of the thymus (see Figure 21.7). The medulla, where thymocytes migrate before leaving the
thymus, contains a less dense collection of thymocytes, epithelial cells, and dendritic cells.

Ag/\ng AND THE...

Immune System

By the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the United States will be 60 years of age or older. The CDC estimates
that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune
systems. This loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. To treat this growing population, medical
professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic
involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year,
and continues until 35-45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s
life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus,
this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan.

Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have
shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor
and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the thymic
microenvironment, so vital to the development of naive T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing
expression of the FOXN1 gene with age.

It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and
testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution
that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases.
What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for
using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naive T cells high. Gene therapies that target
gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. The more we learn through immunosenescence research, the more
opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these therapies will likely take decades to develop. The
ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but there may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes
and hormones.

Secondary Lymphoid Organs and their Roles in Active Immune Responses

Lymphocytes develop and mature in the primary lymphoid organs, but they mount immune responses from the secondary
lymphoid organs. A naive lymphocyte is one that has left the primary organ and entered a secondary lymphoid organ.
Naive lymphocytes are fully functional immunologically, but have yet to encounter an antigen to respond to. In addition
to circulating in the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid organs, which include the lymph
nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules. All of these tissues have many features in common, including the following:
* The presence of lymphoid follicles, the sites of the formation of lymphocytes, with specific B cell-rich and T cell-rich
areas

928 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

¢ An internal structure of reticular fibers with associated fixed macrophages

* Germinal centers, which are the sites of rapidly dividing B lymphocytes and plasma cells, with the exception of the
spleen

¢ Specialized post-capillary vessels known as high endothelial venules; the cells lining these venules are thicker and
more columnar than normal endothelial cells, which allow cells from the blood to directly enter these tissues

Lymph Nodes

Lymph nodes function to remove debris and pathogens from the lymph, and are thus sometimes referred to as the “filters
of the lymph” (Figure 21.8). Any bacteria that infect the interstitial fluid are taken up by the lymphatic capillaries and
transported to a regional lymph node. Dendritic cells and macrophages within this organ internalize and kill many of the
pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body. The lymph node is also the site of adaptive immune
responses mediated by T cells, B cells, and accessory cells of the adaptive immune system. Like the thymus, the bean-
shaped lymph nodes are surrounded by a tough capsule of connective tissue and are separated into compartments by
trabeculae, the extensions of the capsule. In addition to the structure provided by the capsule and trabeculae, the structura
support of the lymph node is provided by a series of reticular fibers laid down by fibroblasts.

greater detail.

The major routes into the lymph node are via afferent lymphatic vessels (see Figure 21.8). Cells and lymph fluid that
leave the lymph node may do so by another set of vessels known as the efferent lymphatic vessels. Lymph enters the lymph
node via the subcapsular sinus, which is occupied by dendritic cells, macrophages, and reticular fibers. Within the cortex of
the lymph node are lymphoid follicles, which consist of germinal centers of rapidly dividing B cells surrounded by a layer
of T cells and other accessory cells. As the lymph continues to flow through the node, it enters the medulla, which consists
of medullary cords of B cells and plasma cells, and the medullary sinuses where the lymph collects before leaving the node
via the efferent lymphatic vessels.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 929

Spleen

In addition to the lymph nodes, the spleen is a major secondary lymphoid organ (Figure 21.9). It is about 12 cm (5 in) long
and is attached to the lateral border of the stomach via the gastrosplenic ligament. The spleen is a fragile organ without a
strong capsule, and is dark red due to its extensive vascularization. The spleen is sometimes called the “filter of the blood”
because of its extensive vascularization and the presence of macrophages and dendritic cells that remove microbes and other
materials from the blood, including dying red blood cells. The spleen also functions as the location of immune responses to
blood-borne pathogens.

from the circulation and presents these antigens to lymphocytes in the white pulp. EM x 660. (Micrograph provided by
the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)

The spleen is also divided by trabeculae of connective tissue, and within each splenic nodule is an area of red pulp,
consisting of mostly red blood cells, and white pulp, which resembles the lymphoid follicles of the lymph nodes. Upon
entering the spleen, the splenic artery splits into several arterioles (surrounded by white pulp) and eventually into sinusoids.
Blood from the capillaries subsequently collects in the venous sinuses and leaves via the splenic vein. The red pulp consists
of reticular fibers with fixed macrophages attached, free macrophages, and all of the other cells typical of the blood,
including some lymphocytes. The white pulp surrounds a central arteriole and consists of germinal centers of dividing B
cells surrounded by T cells and accessory cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, the red pulp primarily
functions as a filtration system of the blood, using cells of the relatively nonspecific immune response, and white pulp is
where adaptive T and B cell responses are mounted.

Lymphoid Nodules

The other lymphoid tissues, the lymphoid nodules, have a simpler architecture than the spleen and lymph nodes in that they
consist of a dense cluster of lymphocytes without a surrounding fibrous capsule. These nodules are located in the respiratory
and digestive tracts, areas routinely exposed to environmental pathogens.

Tonsils are lymphoid nodules located along the inner surface of the pharynx and are important in developing immunity
to oral pathogens (Figure 21.10). The tonsil located at the back of the throat, the pharyngeal tonsil, is sometimes referred
to as the adenoid when swollen. Such swelling is an indication of an active immune response to infection. Histologically,
tonsils do not contain a complete capsule, and the epithelial layer invaginates deeply into the interior of the tonsil to form

930 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

tonsillar crypts. These structures, which accumulate all sorts of materials taken into the body through eating and breathing,
actually “encourage” pathogens to penetrate deep into the tonsillar tissues where they are acted upon by numerous lymphoid
follicles and eliminated. This seems to be the major function of tonsils—to help children’s bodies recognize, destroy, and
develop immunity to common environmental pathogens so that they will be protected in their later lives. Tonsils are often
removed in those children who have recurring throat infections, especially those involving the palatine tonsils on either side
of the throat, whose swelling may interfere with their breathing and/or swallowing.

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) consists of an aggregate of lymphoid follicles directly associated
with the mucous membrane epithelia. MALT makes up dome-shaped structures found underlying the mucosa of the
gastrointestinal tract, breast tissue, lungs, and eyes. Peyer’s patches, a type of MALT in the small intestine, are especially
important for immune responses against ingested substances (Figure 21.11). Peyer’s patches contain specialized endothelial
cells called M (or microfold) cells that sample material from the intestinal lumen and transport it to nearby follicles so that
adaptive immune responses to potential pathogens can be mounted.

Peyer's patches

Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) consists of lymphoid follicular structures with an overlying epithelial
layer found along the bifurcations of the bronchi, and between bronchi and arteries. They also have the typically less-
organized structure of other lymphoid nodules. These tissues, in addition to the tonsils, are effective against inhaled
pathogens.

21.2 | Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Describe the barrier defenses of the body

* Show how the innate immune response is important and how it helps guide and prepare the body for adaptive
immune responses

¢ Describe various soluble factors that are part of the innate immune response
¢ Explain the steps of inflammation and how they lead to destruction of a pathogen
¢ Discuss early induced immune responses and their level of effectiveness

The immune system can be divided into two overlapping mechanisms to destroy pathogens: the innate immune response,
which is relatively rapid but nonspecific and thus not always effective, and the adaptive immune response, which is slower
in its development during an initial infection with a pathogen, but is highly specific and effective at attacking a wide variety
of pathogens (Figure 21.12).

Figure 21.12 Cooperation between Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses The innate immune system
enhances adaptive immune responses so they can be more effective.

Any discussion of the innate immune response usually begins with the physical barriers that prevent pathogens from
entering the body, destroy them after they enter, or flush them out before they can establish themselves in the hospitable
environment of the body’s soft tissues. Barrier defenses are part of the body’s most basic defense mechanisms. The barrier
defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens.

The different modes of barrier defenses are associated with the external surfaces of the body, where pathogens may
try to enter (Table 21.2). The primary barrier to the entrance of microorganisms into the body is the skin. Not only is the
skin covered with a layer of dead, keratinized epithelium that is too dry for bacteria in which to grow, but as these cells are
continuously sloughed off from the skin, they carry bacteria and other pathogens with them. Additionally, sweat and other
skin secretions may lower pH, contain toxic lipids, and physically wash microbes away.

Table 21.2

Another barrier is the saliva in the mouth, which is rich in lysozyme—an enzyme that destroys bacteria by digesting
their cell walls. The acidic environment of the stomach, which is fatal to many pathogens, is also a barrier. Additionally,
the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, eyes, ears, and nose traps both microbes
and debris, and facilitates their removal. In the case of the upper respiratory tract, ciliated epithelial cells move potentially
contaminated mucus upwards to the mouth, where it is then swallowed into the digestive tract, ending up in the harsh acidic
environment of the stomach. Considering how often you breathe compared to how often you eat or perform other activities
that expose you to pathogens, it is not surprising that multiple barrier mechanisms have evolved to work in concert to protect
this vital area.

Cells of the Innate Immune Response

A phagocyte is a cell that is able to surround and engulf a particle or cell, a process called phagocytosis. The phagocytes of
the immune system engulf other particles or cells, either to clean an area of debris, old cells, or to kill pathogenic organisms
such as bacteria. The phagocytes are the body’s fast acting, first line of immunological defense against organisms that have
breached barrier defenses and have entered the vulnerable tissues of the body.

Phagocytes: Macrophages and Neutrophils

Many of the cells of the immune system have a phagocytic ability, at least at some point during their life cycles.
Phagocytosis is an important and effective mechanism of destroying pathogens during innate immune responses. The
phagocyte takes the organism inside itself as a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome and its digestive
enzymes, effectively killing many pathogens. On the other hand, some bacteria including Mycobacteria tuberculosis, the
cause of tuberculosis, may be resistant to these enzymes and are therefore much more difficult to clear from the body.
Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are the major phagocytes of the immune system.

A macrophage is an irregularly shaped phagocyte that is amoeboid in nature and is the most versatile of the phagocytes
in the body. Macrophages move through tissues and squeeze through capillary walls using pseudopodia. They not only
participate in innate immune responses but have also evolved to cooperate with lymphocytes as part of the adaptive
immune response. Macrophages exist in many tissues of the body, either freely roaming through connective tissues or
fixed to reticular fibers within specific tissues such as lymph nodes. When pathogens breach the body’s barrier defenses,
macrophages are the first line of defense (Table 21.3). They are called different names, depending on the tissue: Kupffer
cells in the liver, histiocytes in connective tissue, and alveolar macrophages in the lungs.

A neutrophil is a phagocytic cell that is attracted via chemotaxis from the bloodstream to infected tissues. These
spherical cells are granulocytes. A granulocyte contains cytoplasmic granules, which in turn contain a variety of vasoactive
mediators such as histamine. In contrast, macrophages are agranulocytes. An agranulocyte has few or no cytoplasmic
granules. Whereas macrophages act like sentries, always on guard against infection, neutrophils can be thought of as
military reinforcements that are called into a battle to hasten the destruction of the enemy. Although, usually thought of as
the primary pathogen-killing cell of the inflammatory process of the innate immune response, new research has suggested
that neutrophils play a role in the adaptive immune response as well, just as macrophages do.

A monocyte is a circulating precursor cell that differentiates into either a macrophage or dendritic cell, which can be
rapidly attracted to areas of infection by signal molecules of inflammation.

Natural Killer Cells

NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that have the ability to induce apoptosis, that is, programmed cell death, in cells
infected with intracellular pathogens such as obligate intracellular bacteria and viruses. NK cells recognize these cells by
mechanisms that are still not well understood, but that presumably involve their surface receptors. NK cells can induce
apoptosis, in which a cascade of events inside the cell causes its own death by either of two mechanisms:

1) NK cells are able to respond to chemical signals and express the fas ligand. The fas ligand is a surface molecule
that binds to the fas molecule on the surface of the infected cell, sending it apoptotic signals, thus killing the cell and the
pathogen within it; or

2) The granules of the NK cells release perforins and granzymes. A perforin is a protein that forms pores in the
membranes of infected cells. A granzyme is a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores and
triggers apoptosis intracellularly.

Both mechanisms are especially effective against virally infected cells. If apoptosis is induced before the virus has the
ability to synthesize and assemble all its components, no infectious virus will be released from the cell, thus preventing
further infection.

Recognition of Pathogens

Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogen-
specific molecules, such as bacterial cell wall components or bacterial flagellar proteins, using pattern recognition receptors.
A pattern recognition receptor (PRR) is a membrane-bound receptor that recognizes characteristic features of a pathogen
and molecules released by stressed or damaged cells.

These receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive immune response, are present on the cell
surface whether they are needed or not. Their variety, however, is limited by two factors. First, the fact that each receptor
type must be encoded by a specific gene requires the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make receptors able to
recognize all pathogens. Secondly, the variety of receptors is limited by the finite surface area of the cell membrane. Thus,
the innate immune system must “get by” using only a limited number of receptors that are active against as wide a variety
of pathogens as possible. This strategy is in stark contrast to the approach used by the adaptive immune system, which uses
large numbers of different receptors, each highly specific to a particular pathogen.

Should the cells of the innate immune system come into contact with a species of pathogen they recognize, the cell
will bind to the pathogen and initiate phagocytosis (or cellular apoptosis in the case of an intracellular pathogen) in an effort
to destroy the offending microbe. Receptors vary somewhat according to cell type, but they usually include receptors for
bacterial components and for complement, discussed below.

Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response

The previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can induce cells to change various physiological
characteristics, such as the expression of a particular receptor. These soluble factors are secreted during innate or early
induced responses, and later during adaptive immune responses.

Cytokines and Chemokines

A cytokine is signaling molecule that allows cells to communicate with each other over short distances. Cytokines are
secreted into the intercellular space, and the action of the cytokine induces the receiving cell to change its physiology. A
chemokine is a soluble chemical mediator similar to cytokines except that its function is to attract cells (chemotaxis) from
longer distances.

Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chemotaxis) to learn about phagocyte chemotaxis. Phagocyte
chemotaxis is the movement of phagocytes according to the secretion of chemical messengers in the form of
interleukins and other chemokines. By what means does a phagocyte destroy a bacterium that it has ingested?

Early induced Proteins

Early induced proteins are those that are not constitutively present in the body, but are made as they are needed early during
the innate immune response. Interferons are an example of early induced proteins. Cells infected with viruses secrete
interferons that travel to adjacent cells and induce them to make antiviral proteins. Thus, even though the initial cell is
sacrificed, the surrounding cells are protected. Other early induced proteins specific for bacterial cell wall components are
mannose-binding protein and C-reactive protein, made in the liver, which bind specifically to polysaccharide components
of the bacterial cell wall. Phagocytes such as macrophages have receptors for these proteins, and they are thus able to
recognize them as they are bound to the bacteria. This brings the phagocyte and bacterium into close proximity and enhances
the phagocytosis of the bacterium by the process known as opsonization. Opsonization is the tagging of a pathogen for
phagocytosis by the binding of an antibody or an antimicrobial protein.

Complement System

The complement system is a series of proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma. As such, these proteins are not
considered part of the early induced immune response, even though they share features with some of the antibacterial
proteins of this class. Made in the liver, they have a variety of functions in the innate immune response, using what is known
as the “alternate pathway” of complement activation. Additionally, complement functions in the adaptive immune response
as well, in what is called the classical pathway. The complement system consists of several proteins that enzymatically
alter and fragment later proteins in a series, which is why it is termed cascade. Once activated, the series of reactions is
irreversible, and releases fragments that have the following actions:

* Bind to the cell membrane of the pathogen that activates it, labeling it for phagocytosis (opsonization)

* Diffuse away from the pathogen and act as chemotactic agents to attract phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation

¢ Form damaging pores in the plasma membrane of the pathogen

Figure 21.13 shows the classical pathway, which requires antibodies of the adaptive immune response. The alternate

pathway does not require an antibody to become activated.

into the hyperosmotic cytoplasm, causing the
pathogen to lyse.

Figure 21.13 Complement Cascade and Function The classical pathway, used during adaptive immune responses,
occurs when C1 reacts with antibodies that have bound an antigen.

The splitting of the C3 protein is the common step to both pathways. In the alternate pathway, C3 is activated
spontaneously and, after reacting with the molecules factor P, factor B, and factor D, splits apart. The larger fragment, C3b,
binds to the surface of the pathogen and C3a, the smaller fragment, diffuses outward from the site of activation and attracts
phagocytes to the site of infection. Surface-bound C3b then activates the rest of the cascade, with the last five proteins,
C5-C9, forming the membrane-attack complex (MAC). The MAC can kill certain pathogens by disrupting their osmotic
balance. The MAC is especially effective against a broad range of bacteria. The classical pathway is similar, except the
early stages of activation require the presence of antibody bound to antigen, and thus is dependent on the adaptive immune
response. The earlier fragments of the cascade also have important functions. Phagocytic cells such as macrophages and
neutrophils are attracted to an infection site by chemotactic attraction to smaller complement fragments. Additionally, once
they arrive, their receptors for surface-bound C3b opsonize the pathogen for phagocytosis and destruction.

Inflammatory Response

The hallmark of the innate immune response is inflammation. Inflammation is something everyone has experienced. Stub a
toe, cut a finger, or do any activity that causes tissue damage and inflammation will result, with its four characteristics: heat,
redness, pain, and swelling (“loss of function” is sometimes mentioned as a fifth characteristic). It is important to note that
inflammation does not have to be initiated by an infection, but can also be caused by tissue injuries. The release of damaged
cellular contents into the site of injury is enough to stimulate the response, even in the absence of breaks in physical barriers
that would allow pathogens to enter (by hitting your thumb with a hammer, for example). The inflammatory reaction brings
in phagocytic cells to the damaged area to clear cellular debris and to set the stage for wound repair (Figure 21.14).

blood influx causes the
wound to swell, redden, and
become warm and painful.

Figure 21.14

This reaction also brings in the cells of the innate immune system, allowing them to get rid of the sources of a possible
infection. Inflammation is part of a very basic form of immune response. The process not only brings fluid and cells into
the site to destroy the pathogen and remove it and debris from the site, but also helps to isolate the site, limiting the spread
of the pathogen. Acute inflammation is a short-term inflammatory response to an insult to the body. If the cause of the
inflammation is not resolved, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which is associated with major tissue destruction
and fibrosis. Chronic inflammation is ongoing inflammation. It can be caused by foreign bodies, persistent pathogens, and
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

There are four important parts to the inflammatory response:

* Tissue Injury. The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release of mast cell granules and their potent
inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Histamine increases the diameter o
local blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in blood flow. Histamine also increases the permeability o
local capillaries, causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid. This causes the swelling associated with
inflammation.
Additionally, injured cells, phagocytes, and basophils are sources of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins
and leukotrienes. Leukotrienes attract neutrophils from the blood by chemotaxis and increase vascular permeability.
Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major cause of the pain associated
with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen relieve pain by inhibiting
prostaglandin production.

* Vasodilation. Many inflammatory mediators such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of loca
capillaries. This causes increased blood flow and is responsible for the heat and redness of inflamed tissue. It allows
greater access of the blood to the site of inflammation.

* Increased Vascular Permeability. At the same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the loca
vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial space, resulting in the swelling, or edema, associated with
inflammation.

* Recruitment of Phagocytes. Leukotrienes are particularly good at attracting neutrophils from the blood to the site
of infection by chemotaxis. Following an early neutrophil infiltrate stimulated by macrophage cytokines, more
macrophages are recruited to clean up the debris left over at the site. When local infections are severe, neutrophils are
attracted to the sites of infections in large numbers, and as they phagocytose the pathogens and subsequently die, their
accumulated cellular remains are visible as pus at the infection site.

Overall, inflammation is valuable for many reasons. Not only are the pathogens killed and debris removed, but the
increase in vascular permeability encourages the entry of clotting factors, the first step towards wound repair. Inflammation
also facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the adaptive immune
response.

21.3 | The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes
and Their Functional Types

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain the advantages of the adaptive immune response over the innate immune response
¢ List the various characteristics of an antigen
¢ Describe the types of T cell antigen receptors
* Outline the steps of T cell development
¢ Describe the major T cell types and their functions

Innate immune responses (and early induced responses) are in many cases ineffective at completely controlling pathogen
growth. However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to strengthen and either
control or eliminate the pathogen. The innate immune system also sends signals to the cells of the adaptive immune system,
guiding them in how to attack the pathogen. Thus, these are the two important arms of the immune response.

The Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response

The specificity of the adaptive immune response—its ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a
wide variety of pathogens—is its great strength. Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with pathogens,
are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. The adaptive immune response to these antigens is
so versatile that it can respond to nearly any pathogen. This increase in specificity comes because the adaptive immune
response has a unique way to develop as many as 10", or 100 trillion, different receptors to recognize nearly every
conceivable pathogen. How could so many different types of antibodies be encoded? And what about the many specificities
of T cells? There is not nearly enough DNA in a cell to have a separate gene for each specificity. The mechanism was finally
worked out in the 1970s and 1980s using the new tools of molecular genetics

Primary Disease and Immunological Memory

The immune system’s first exposure to a pathogen is called a primary adaptive response. Symptoms of a first infection,
called primary disease, are always relatively severe because it takes time for an initial adaptive immune response to a
pathogen to become effective.

Upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, a secondary adaptive immune response is generated, which is stronger
and faster that the primary response. The secondary adaptive response often eliminates a pathogen before it can cause
significant tissue damage or any symptoms. Without symptoms, there is no disease, and the individual is not even aware
of the infection. This secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which protects us from getting diseases
repeatedly from the same pathogen. By this mechanism, an individual’s exposure to pathogens early in life spares the person
from these diseases later in life.

Self Recognition

A third important feature of the adaptive immune response is its ability to distinguish between self-antigens, those that are
normally present in the body, and foreign antigens, those that might be on a potential pathogen. As T and B cells mature,
there are mechanisms in place that prevent them from recognizing self-antigen, preventing a damaging immune response
against the body. These mechanisms are not 100 percent effective, however, and their breakdown leads to autoimmune
diseases, which will be discussed later in this chapter.

T Cell-Mediated Immune Responses

The primary cells that control the adaptive immune response are the lymphocytes, the T and B cells. T cells are particularly
important, as they not only control a multitude of immune responses directly, but also control B cell immune responses in
many cases as well. Thus, many of the decisions about how to attack a pathogen are made at the T cell level, and knowledge
of their functional types is crucial to understanding the functioning and regulation of adaptive immune responses as a whole.

T lymphocytes recognize antigens based on a two-chain protein receptor. The most common and important of these
are the alpha-beta T cell receptors (Figure 21.15).

Figure 21.15 Alpha-beta T Cell Receptor Notice the constant and variable regions of each chain, anchored by the
transmembrane region.

There are two chains in the T cell receptor, and each chain consists of two domains. The variable region domain
is furthest away from the T cell membrane and is so named because its amino acid sequence varies between receptors.
In contrast, the constant region domain has less variation. The differences in the amino acid sequences of the variable
domains are the molecular basis of the diversity of antigens the receptor can recognize. Thus, the antigen-binding site of the
receptor consists of the terminal ends of both receptor chains, and the amino acid sequences of those two areas combine to
determine its antigenic specificity. Each T cell produces only one type of receptor and thus is specific for a single particular
antigen.

Antigens

Antigens on pathogens are usually large and complex, and consist of many antigenic determinants. An antigenic
determinant (epitope) is one of the small regions within an antigen to which a receptor can bind, and antigenic determinants
are limited by the size of the receptor itself. They usually consist of six or fewer amino acid residues in a protein, or one
or two sugar moieties in a carbohydrate antigen. Antigenic determinants on a carbohydrate antigen are usually less diverse
than on a protein antigen. Carbohydrate antigens are found on bacterial cell walls and on red blood cells (the ABO blood
group antigens). Protein antigens are complex because of the variety of three-dimensional shapes that proteins can assume,
and are especially important for the immune responses to viruses and worm parasites. It is the interaction of the shape of the
antigen and the complementary shape of the amino acids of the antigen-binding site that accounts for the chemical basis of
specificity (Figure 21.16).

ability of T cells with three different specificities to bind to different parts of the same antigen.

Antigen Processing and Presentation

Although Figure 21.16 shows T cell receptors interacting with antigenic determinants directly, the mechanism that T cells
use to recognize antigens is, in reality, much more complex. T cells do not recognize free-floating or cell-bound antigens
as they appear on the surface of the pathogen. They only recognize antigen on the surface of specialized cells called
antigen-presenting cells. Antigens are internalized by these cells. Antigen processing is a mechanism that enzymatically
cleaves the antigen into smaller pieces. The antigen fragments are then brought to the cell’s surface and associated with a
specialized type of antigen-presenting protein known as a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The MHC
is the cluster of genes that encode these antigen-presenting molecules. The association of the antigen fragments with an
MHC molecule on the surface of a cell is known as antigen presentation and results in the recognition of antigen by a
T cell. This association of antigen and MHC occurs inside the cell, and it is the complex of the two that is brought to the
surface. The peptide-binding cleft is a small indentation at the end of the MHC molecule that is furthest away from the
cell membrane; it is here that the processed fragment of antigen sits. MHC molecules are capable of presenting a variety of
antigens, depending on the amino acid sequence, in their peptide-binding clefts. It is the combination of the MHC molecule
and the fragment of the original peptide or carbohydrate that is actually physically recognized by the T cell receptor (Figure
21.17).

Figure 21.17 Antigen Processing and Presentation

Two distinct types of MHC molecules, MHC class I and MHC class II, play roles in antigen presentation. Although
produced from different genes, they both have similar functions. They bring processed antigen to the surface of the cell
via a transport vesicle and present the antigen to the T cell and its receptor. Antigens from different classes of pathogens,
however, use different MHC classes and take different routes through the cell to get to the surface for presentation. The
basic mechanism, though, is the same. Antigens are processed by digestion, are brought into the endomembrane system of
the cell, and then are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell for antigen recognition by a T cell. Intracellular
antigens are typical of viruses, which replicate inside the cell, and certain other intracellular parasites and bacteria. These
antigens are processed in the cytosol by an enzyme complex known as the proteasome and are then brought into the
endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) system, where they interact with class I
MHC molecules and are eventually transported to the cell surface by a transport vesicle.

Extracellular antigens, characteristic of many bacteria, parasites, and fungi that do not replicate inside the cell’s
cytoplasm, are brought into the endomembrane system of the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The resulting vesicle
fuses with vesicles from the Golgi complex, which contain pre-formed MHC class II molecules. After fusion of these two
vesicles and the association of antigen and MHC, the new vesicle makes its way to the cell surface.

Professional Antigen-presenting Cells

Many cell types express class I molecules for the presentation of intracellular antigens. These MHC molecules may then
stimulate a cytotoxic T cell immune response, eventually destroying the cell and the pathogen within. This is especially
important when it comes to the most common class of intracellular pathogens, the virus. Viruses infect nearly every tissue
of the body, so all these tissues must necessarily be able to express class I MHC or no T cell response can be made.

On the other hand, class II MHC molecules are expressed only on the cells of the immune system, specifically cells that
affect other arms of the immune response. Thus, these cells are called “professional” antigen-presenting cells to distinguish
them from those that bear class I MHC. The three types of professional antigen presenters are macrophages, dendritic cells,
and B cells (Table 21.4).

Macrophages stimulate T cells to release cytokines that enhance phagocytosis. Dendritic cells also kill pathogens
by phagocytosis (see Figure 21.17), but their major function is to bring antigens to regional draining lymph nodes. The
lymph nodes are the locations in which most T cell responses against pathogens of the interstitial tissues are mounted.
Macrophages are found in the skin and in the lining of mucosal surfaces, such as the nasopharynx, stomach, lungs, and
intestines. B cells may also present antigens to T cells, which are necessary for certain types of antibody responses, to be
covered later in this chapter.

T Cell Development and Differentiation

The process of eliminating T cells that might attack the cells of one’s own body is referred to as T cell tolerance. While
thymocytes are in the cortex of the thymus, they are referred to as “double negatives,” meaning that they do not bear the
CD4 or CD8 molecules that you can use to follow their pathways of differentiation (Figure 21.18). In the cortex of the
thymus, they are exposed to cortical epithelial cells. In a process known as positive selection, double-negative thymocytes
bind to the MHC molecules they observe on the thymic epithelia, and the MHC molecules of “self” are selected. This
mechanism kills many thymocytes during T cell differentiation. In fact, only two percent of the thymocytes that enter the
thymus leave it as mature, functional T cells.

developmental stages that ensures both function and tolerance before they leave and become functional components
of the adaptive immune response.

Later, the cells become double positives that express both CD4 and CD8 markers and move from the cortex to the
junction between the cortex and medulla. It is here that negative selection takes place. In negative selection, self-antigens
are brought into the thymus from other parts of the body by professional antigen-presenting cells. The T cells that bind to
these self-antigens are selected for negatively and are killed by apoptosis. In summary, the only T cells left are those that
can bind to MHC molecules of the body with foreign antigens presented on their binding clefts, preventing an attack on
one’s own body tissues, at least under normal circumstances. Tolerance can be broken, however, by the development of an
autoimmune response, to be discussed later in this chapter.

The cells that leave the thymus become single positives, expressing either CD4 or CD8, but not both (see Figure
21.18). The CD4* T cells will bind to class II MHC and the CD8* cells will bind to class I MHC. The discussion that
follows explains the functions of these molecules and how they can be used to differentiate between the different T cell
functional types.

944 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

Mechanisms of T Cell-mediated Immune Responses

Mature T cells become activated by recognizing processed foreign antigen in association with a self-MHC molecule and
begin dividing rapidly by mitosis. This proliferation of T cells is called clonal expansion and is necessary to make the
immune response strong enough to effectively control a pathogen. How does the body select only those T cells that are
needed against a specific pathogen? Again, the specificity of a T cell is based on the amino acid sequence and the three-
dimensional shape of the antigen-binding site formed by the variable regions of the two chains of the T cell receptor (Figure
21.19). Clonal selection is the process of antigen binding only to those T cells that have receptors specific to that antigen.
Each T cell that is activated has a specific receptor “hard-wired” into its DNA, and all of its progeny will have identical
DNA and T cell receptors, forming clones of the original T cell.

Figure 21.19 Clonal Selection and Expansion of T Lymphocytes Stem cells differentiate into T cells with specific
receptors, called clones. The clones with receptors specific for antigens on the pathogen are selected for and
expanded.

Clonal Selection and Expansion

The clonal selection theory was proposed by Frank Burnet in the 1950s. However, the term clonal selection is not a complete
description of the theory, as clonal expansion goes hand in glove with the selection process. The main tenet of the theory
is that a typical individual has a multitude (1014) of different types of T cell clones based on their receptors. In this use, a
clone is a group of lymphocytes that share the same antigen receptor. Each clone is necessarily present in the body in low
numbers. Otherwise, the body would not have room for lymphocytes with so many specificities.

Only those clones of lymphocytes whose receptors are activated by the antigen are stimulated to proliferate. Keep in
mind that most antigens have multiple antigenic determinants, so a T cell response to a typical antigen involves a polyclonal
response. A polyclonal response is the stimulation of multiple T cell clones. Once activated, the selected clones increase in
number and make many copies of each cell type, each clone with its unique receptor. By the time this process is complete,
the body will have large numbers of specific lymphocytes available to fight the infection (see Figure 21.19).

The Cellular Basis of Immunological Memory

As already discussed, one of the major features of an adaptive immune response is the development of immunological
memory.

During a primary adaptive immune response, both memory T cells and effector T cells are generated. Memory T cells
are long-lived and can even persist for a lifetime. Memory cells are primed to act rapidly. Thus, any subsequent exposure

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 945

to the pathogen will elicit a very rapid T cell response. This rapid, secondary adaptive response generates large numbers of
effector T cells so fast that the pathogen is often overwhelmed before it can cause any symptoms of disease. This is what
is meant by immunity to a disease. The same pattern of primary and secondary immune responses occurs in B cells and the
antibody response, as will be discussed later in the chapter.

T Cell Types and their Functions

In the discussion of T cell development, you saw that mature T cells express either the CD4 marker or the CD8 marker,
but not both. These markers are cell adhesion molecules that keep the T cell in close contact with the antigen-presenting
cell by directly binding to the MHC molecule (to a different part of the molecule than does the antigen). Thus, T cells and
antigen-presenting cells are held together in two ways: by CD4 or CD8 attaching to MHC and by the T cell receptor binding
to antigen (Figure 21.20).

pathogen is processed and presented in the binding cleft of a class Il MHC molecule, and this interaction is
strengthened by the CD4 molecule. (b) CD8 is associated with cytotoxic T cells. An intracellular pathogen is presented
by aclass | MHC molecule, and CD8 interacts with it.

Although the correlation is not 100 percent, CD4-bearing T cells are associated with helper functions and CD8-bearing
T cells are associated with cytotoxicity. These functional distinctions based on CD4 and CD8 markers are useful in defining
the function of each type.

Helper T Cells and their Cytokines

Helper T cells (Th), bearing the CD4 molecule, function by secreting cytokines that act to enhance other immune
responses. There are two classes of Th cells, and they act on different components of the immune response. These cells are
not distinguished by their surface molecules but by the characteristic set of cytokines they secrete (Table 21.5).

Th1 cells are a type of helper T cell that secretes cytokines that regulate the immunological activity and development
of a variety of cells, including macrophages and other types of T cells.

Th2 cells, on the other hand, are cytokine-secreting cells that act on B cells to drive their differentiation into plasma
cells that make antibody. In fact, T cell help is required for antibody responses to most protein antigens, and these are called
T cell-dependent antigens.

Cytotoxic T cells

Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) are T cells that kill target cells by inducing apoptosis using the same mechanism as NK cells. They
either express Fas ligand, which binds to the fas molecule on the target cell, or act by using perforins and granzymes
contained in their cytoplasmic granules. As was discussed earlier with NK cells, killing a virally infected cell before the
virus can complete its replication cycle results in the production of no infectious particles. As more Tc cells are developed

946 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

during an immune response, they overwhelm the ability of the virus to cause disease. In addition, each Tc cell can kill more
than one target cell, making them especially effective. Tc cells are so important in the antiviral immune response that some
speculate that this was the main reason the adaptive immune response evolved in the first place.

Regulatory T Cells

Regulatory T cells (Treg), or suppressor T cells, are the most recently discovered of the types listed here, so less is
understood about them. In addition to CD4, they bear the molecules CD25 and FOXP3. Exactly how they function is still
under investigation, but it is known that they suppress other T cell immune responses. This is an important feature of
the immune response, because if clonal expansion during immune responses were allowed to continue uncontrolled, these
responses could lead to autoimmune diseases and other medical issues.

Not only do T cells directly destroy pathogens, but they regulate nearly all other types of the adaptive immune response
as well, as evidenced by the functions of the T cell types, their surface markers, the cells they work on, and the types of
pathogens they work against (see Table 21.5).

21.4 | The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes
and Antibodies

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain how B cells mature and how B cell tolerance develops
¢ Discuss how B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma cells

¢ Describe the structure of the antibody classes and their functions

Antibodies were the first component of the adaptive immune response to be characterized by scientists working on the
immune system. It was already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were immune to re-infection
with the same pathogen. Early microbiologists took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a fresh culture of the
same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope. The bacteria became clumped in a process called
agglutination. When a different bacterial species was used, the agglutination did not happen. Thus, there was something in
the serum of immune individuals that could specifically bind to and agglutinate bacteria.

Scientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody molecule, also called an immunoglobulin. What
is an antibody? An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form of a B cell receptor. (In fact, surface immunoglobulin is
another name for the B cell receptor.) Not surprisingly, the same genes encode both the secreted antibodies and the surface
immunoglobulins. One minor difference in the way these proteins are synthesized distinguishes a naive B cell with antibody
on its surface from an antibody-secreting plasma cell with no antibodies on its surface. The antibodies of the plasma cell
have the exact same antigen-binding site and specificity as their B cell precursors.

There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific
functions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of antibody
functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.

B cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells. B cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen
and do not require the participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 947

B Cell Differentiation and Activation

B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are
generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells.

B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells. Central
tolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical
and well established. In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on
tissues are signaled to commit suicide by apoptosis, removing them from the population. In the process of clonal anergy,
however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function.

Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. In peripheral tolerance,
functional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens require
signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but receives no signals
from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is destroyed. This is yet another
example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response.

After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave
the secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole
differentiation process started. After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their energy is devoted
to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be terminally differentiated.

The final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell.
Memory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response when
compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.

Antibody Structure

Antibodies are glycoproteins consisting of two types of polypeptide chains with attached carbohydrates. The heavy chain
and the light chain are the two polypeptides that form the antibody. The main differences between the classes of antibodies
are in the differences between their heavy chains, but as you shall see, the light chains have an important role, forming part
of the antigen-binding site on the antibody molecules.

Four-chain Models of Antibody Structures

All antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. (Some antibodies contain multiple
units of this four-chain structure.) The Fc region of the antibody is formed by the two heavy chains coming together,
usually linked by disulfide bonds (Figure 21.21). The Fc portion of the antibody is important in that many effector cells
of the immune system have Fc receptors. Cells having these receptors can then bind to antibody-coated pathogens, greatly
increasing the specificity of the effector cells. At the other end of the molecule are two identical antigen-binding sites.

Five Classes of Antibodies and their Functions

In general, antibodies have two basic functions. They can act as the B cell antigen receptor or they can be secreted, circulate,
and bind to a pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the immune response. Of the five antibody
classes, notice that only two can function as the antigen receptor for naive B cells: IgM and IgD (Figure 21.22). Mature
B cells that leave the bone marrow express both IgM and IgD, but both antibodies have the same antigen specificity. Only
IgM is secreted, however, and no other nonreceptor function for IgD has been discovered.

Figure 21.22 Five Classes of Antibodies

IgM consists of five four-chain structures (20 total chains with 10 identical antigen-binding sites) and is thus the largest
of the antibody molecules. IgM is usually the first antibody made during a primary response. Its 10 antigen-binding sites and
large shape allow it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces. It is excellent at binding complement proteins and activating
the complement cascade, consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis, opsonization, and cell lysis. Thus, it is a very
effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response. As the primary response proceeds, the
antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the process known as class switching. Class switching
is the change of one antibody class to another. While the class of antibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding
sites do not. Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to the pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.

IgG is a major antibody of late primary responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood. This
is because class switching occurs during primary responses. IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the
blood and can activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking advantage of its antibacterial activities.
Furthermore, this class of antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the developing fetus from disease exits the
blood to the interstitial fluid to fight extracellular pathogens.

IgA exists in two forms, a four-chain monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine gland
secretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears. Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to leave
the interior of the body to protect body surfaces. IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody is present in
mother’s breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.

IgE is usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis. It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood, because
its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on the surfaces of mast cells. IgE makes mast cell degranulation
very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to his or her mast cells. In
this person, eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes causing severe allergic reactions, including
anaphylaxis, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.

Clonal Selection of B Cells

Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells. Only B cells with appropriate antigen
specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure 21.23). Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies with antigenic
specificity identical to those that were on the surfaces of the selected B cells. Notice in the figure that both plasma cells and
memory B cells are generated simultaneously.

Figure 21.23 Clonal Selection of B Cells During a primary B cell immune response, both antibody-secreting plasma
cells and memory B cells are produced. These memory cells lead to the differentiation of more plasma cells and
memory B cells during secondary responses.

Primary versus Secondary B Cell Responses

Primary and secondary responses as they relate to T cells were discussed earlier. This section will look at these responses
with B cells and antibody production. Because antibodies are easily obtained from blood samples, they are easy to follow
and graph (Figure 21.24). As you will see from the figure, the primary response to an antigen (representing a pathogen)
is delayed by several days. This is the time it takes for the B cell clones to expand and differentiate into plasma cells. The
level of antibody produced is low, but it is sufficient for immune protection. The second time a person encounters the same
antigen, there is no time delay, and the amount of antibody made is much higher. Thus, the secondary antibody response
overwhelms the pathogens quickly and, in most situations, no symptoms are felt. When a different antigen is used, another
primary response is made with its low antibody levels and time delay.

Active versus Passive Immunity

Immunity to pathogens, and the ability to control pathogen growth so that damage to the tissues of the body is limited, can
be acquired by (1) the active development of an immune response in the infected individual or (2) the passive transfer of
immune components from an immune individual to a nonimmune one. Both active and passive immunity have examples in
the natural world and as part of medicine.

Active immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual
(Table 21.6). Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the focus of this chapter. Artificially
acquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines. A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components
that, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened primary
immune response) without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can avoid the damage
from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of protection from immunological
memory. The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the twentieth century and led to the eradication
of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio, measles, and whooping cough.

Active versus Passive Immunity
Natural Artificial

Active | Adaptive immune response Vaccine response

Passive | Trans-placental antibodies/breastfeeding | Immune globulin injections

Table 21.6

Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own
active immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred from
the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for
the first few months of its life. As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during
breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory of the mother to the pathogens to which
she has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins,
taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily
protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the
lack of the development of immunological memory. Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited
time before they degrade.

example of natural immunity acquired passively?

T cell-dependent versus T cell-independent Antigens

As discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to
complex antigens such as those made by proteins. On the other hand, some antigens are T cell independent. A T cell-
independent antigen usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of bacteria. Each
antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent antigen leads to
crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell. The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell
cytokines.

A T cell-dependent antigen, on the other hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and thus
does not crosslink surface antibody with the same efficiency. To elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T cells must
come close together (Figure 21.25). The B cell must receive two signals to become activated. Its surface immunoglobulin
must recognize native antigen. Some of this antigen is internalized, processed, and presented to the Th2 cells on a class II
MHC molecule. The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is activated to secrete cytokines that diffuse to the B
cell, finally activating it completely. Thus, the B cell receives signals from both its surface antibody and the T cell via its
cytokines, and acts as a professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.

21.5 | The Immune Response against Pathogens

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain the development of immunological competence
¢ Describe the mucosal immune response
¢ Discuss immune responses against bacterial, viral, fungal, and animal pathogens

* Describe different ways pathogens evade immune responses

Now that you understand the development of mature, naive B cells and T cells, and some of their major functions, how do all
of these various cells, proteins, and cytokines come together to actually resolve an infection? Ideally, the immune response

952 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

will rid the body of a pathogen entirely. The adaptive immune response, with its rapid clonal expansion, is well suited to
this purpose. Think of a primary infection as a race between the pathogen and the immune system. The pathogen bypasses
barrier defenses and starts multiplying in the host’s body. During the first 4 to 5 days, the innate immune response will
partially control, but not stop, pathogen growth. As the adaptive immune response gears up, however, it will begin to clear
the pathogen from the body, while at the same time becoming stronger and stronger. When following antibody responses
in patients with a particular disease such as a virus, this clearance is referred to as seroconversion (sero- = “serum”).
Seroconversion is the reciprocal relationship between virus levels in the blood and antibody levels. As the antibody levels
rise, the virus levels decline, and this is a sign that the immune response is being at least partially effective (partially, because
in many diseases, seroconversion does not necessarily mean a patient is getting well).

An excellent example of this is seroconversion during HIV disease (Figure 21.26). Notice that antibodies are made
early in this disease, and the increase in anti-HIV antibodies correlates with a decrease in detectable virus in the blood.
Although these antibodies are an important marker for diagnosing the disease, they are not sufficient to completely clear
the virus. Several years later, the vast majority of these individuals, if untreated, will lose their entire adaptive immune
response, including the ability to make antibodies, during the final stages of AIDS.

adaptive immune responses are compromised.

Everyday CONNECTION

Disinfectants: Fighting the Good Fight?

“Wash your hands!” Parents have been telling their children this for generations. Dirty hands can spread disease. But
is it possible to get rid of enough pathogens that children will never get sick? Are children who avoid exposure to
pathogens better off? The answers to both these questions appears to be no.

Antibacterial wipes, soaps, gels, and even toys with antibacterial substances embedded in their plastic are
ubiquitous in our society. Still, these products do not rid the skin and gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, and it would
be harmful to our health if they did. We need these nonpathogenic bacteria on and within our bodies to keep the
pathogenic ones from growing. The urge to keep children perfectly clean is thus probably misguided. Children will get
sick anyway, and the later benefits of immunological memory far outweigh the minor discomforts of most childhood
diseases. In fact, getting diseases such as chickenpox or measles later in life is much harder on the adult and are
associated with symptoms significantly worse than those seen in the childhood illnesses. Of course, vaccinations help
children avoid some illnesses, but there are so many pathogens, we will never be immune to them all.

Could over-cleanliness be the reason that allergies are increasing in more developed countries? Some scientists
think so. Allergies are based on an IgE antibody response. Many scientists think the system evolved to help the body
rid itself of worm parasites. The hygiene theory is the idea that the immune system is geared to respond to antigens,
and if pathogens are not present, it will respond instead to inappropriate antigens such as allergens and self-antigens.
This is one explanation for the rising incidence of allergies in developed countries, where the response to nonpathogens
like pollen, shrimp, and cat dander cause allergic responses while not serving any protective function.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 953

The Mucosal Immune Response

Mucosal tissues are major barriers to the entry of pathogens into the body. The IgA (and sometimes IgM) antibodies in
mucus and other secretions can bind to the pathogen, and in the cases of many viruses and bacteria, neutralize them.
Neutralization is the process of coating a pathogen with antibodies, making it physically impossible for the pathogen to
bind to receptors. Neutralization, which occurs in the blood, lymph, and other body fluids and secretions, protects the body
constantly. Neutralizing antibodies are the basis for the disease protection offered by vaccines. Vaccinations for diseases
that commonly enter the body via mucous membranes, such as influenza, are usually formulated to enhance IgA production.

Immune responses in some mucosal tissues such as the Peyer’s patches (see Figure 21.11) in the small intestine take
up particulate antigens by specialized cells known as microfold or M cells (Figure 21.27). These cells allow the body to
sample potential pathogens from the intestinal lumen. Dendritic cells then take the antigen to the regional lymph nodes,
where an immune response is mounted.

Organized
lymphoid
follicles

Figure 21.27 IgA Immunity The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer’s patches of the small intestine
generate IgA immunity. Both use M cells to transport antigen inside the body so that immune responses can be
mounted.

Defenses against Bacteria and Fungi

The body fights bacterial pathogens with a wide variety of immunological mechanisms, essentially trying to find one that is
effective. Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of leprosy, are resistant to lysosomal enzymes and can persist
in macrophage organelles or escape into the cytosol. In such situations, infected macrophages receiving cytokine signals
from Th1 cells turn on special metabolic pathways. Macrophage oxidative metabolism is hostile to intracellular bacteria,
often relying on the production of nitric oxide to kill the bacteria inside the macrophage.

Fungal infections, such as those from Aspergillus, Candida, and Pneumocystis, are largely opportunistic infections that
take advantage of suppressed immune responses. Most of the same immune mechanisms effective against bacteria have
similar effects on fungi, both of which have characteristic cell wall structures that protect their cells.

Defenses against Parasites

Worm parasites such as helminths are seen as the primary reason why the mucosal immune response, IgE-mediated allergy
and asthma, and eosinophils evolved. These parasites were at one time very common in human society. When infecting a
human, often via contaminated food, some worms take up residence in the gastrointestinal tract. Eosinophils are attracted to

954 CHAPTER 21| THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

the site by T cell cytokines, which release their granule contents upon their arrival. Mast cell degranulation also occurs, and
the fluid leakage caused by the increase in local vascular permeability is thought to have a flushing action on the parasite,
expelling its larvae from the body. Furthermore, if IgE labels the parasite, the eosinophils can bind to it by its Fc receptor.

Defenses against Viruses

The primary mechanisms against viruses are NK cells, interferons, and cytotoxic T cells. Antibodies are effective against
viruses mostly during protection, where an immune individual can neutralize them based on a previous exposure.
Antibodies have no effect on viruses or other intracellular pathogens once they enter the cell, since antibodies are not able
to penetrate the plasma membrane of the cell. Many cells respond to viral infections by downregulating their expression of
MHC class I molecules. This is to the advantage of the virus, because without class I expression, cytotoxic T cells have no
activity. NK cells, however, can recognize virally infected class I-negative cells and destroy them. Thus, NK and cytotoxic
T cells have complementary activities against virally infected cells.

Interferons have activity in slowing viral replication and are used in the treatment of certain viral diseases, such as
hepatitis B and C, but their ability to eliminate the virus completely is limited. The cytotoxic T cell response, though, is
key, as it eventually overwhelms the virus and kills infected cells before the virus can complete its replicative cycle. Clonal
expansion and the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill more than one target cell make these cells especially effective against
viruses. In fact, without cytotoxic T cells, it is likely that humans would all die at some point from a viral infection (if no
vaccine were available).

Evasion of the Immune System by Pathogens

It is important to keep in mind that although the immune system has evolved to be able to control many pathogens,
pathogens themselves have evolved ways to evade the immune response. An example already mentioned is in
Mycobactrium tuberculosis, which has evolved a complex cell wall that is resistant to the digestive enzymes of the
macrophages that ingest them, and thus persists in the host, causing the chronic disease tuberculosis. This section briefly
summarizes other ways in which pathogens can “outwit” immune responses. But keep in mind, although it seems as if
pathogens have a will of their own, they do not. All of these evasive “strategies” arose strictly by evolution, driven by
selection.

Bacteria sometimes evade immune responses because they exist in multiple strains, such as different groups of
Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is commonly found in minor skin infections, such as boils, and some healthy people
harbor it in their nose. One small group of strains of this bacterium, however, called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, has become resistant to multiple antibiotics and is essentially untreatable. Different bacterial strains differ in the
antigens on their surfaces. The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not affect the other; thus, the species
survives.

Another method of immune evasion is mutation. Because viruses’ surface molecules mutate continuously, viruses like
influenza change enough each year that the flu vaccine for one year may not protect against the flu common to the next.
New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season.

Genetic recombination—the combining of gene segments from two different pathogens—is an efficient form of
immune evasion. For example, the influenza virus contains gene segments that can recombine when two different viruses
infect the same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.

Pathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different
types. Viruses are especially good at evading the immune response in this way, and many types of viruses have been shown
to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV.

21.6 | Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive
Immune Responses

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Discuss inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies
¢ Explain the four types of hypersensitivity and how they differ
* Give an example of how autoimmune disease breaks tolerance

This section is about how the immune system goes wrong. When it goes haywire, and becomes too weak or too strong, it
leads to a state of disease. The factors that maintain immunological homeostasis are complex and incompletely understood.

Immunodeficiencies

As you have seen, the immune system is quite complex. It has many pathways using many cell types and signals. Because it
is so complex, there are many ways for it to go wrong. Inherited immunodeficiencies arise from gene mutations that affect

This content is available for free at http://textbookequity.org/anatomy-and-physiology-volume-2 or at http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 955

specific components of the immune response. There are also acquired immunodeficiencies with potentially devastating
effects on the immune system, such as HIV.

Inherited Immunodeficiencies

A list of all inherited immunodeficiencies is well beyond the scope of this book. The list is almost as long as the list of cells,
proteins, and signaling molecules of the immune system itself. Some deficiencies, such as those for complement, cause
only a higher susceptibility to some Gram-negative bacteria. Others are more severe in their consequences. Certainly, the
most serious of the inherited immunodeficiencies is severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). This disease is
complex because it is caused by many different genetic defects. What groups them together is the fact that both the B cell
and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are affected.

Children with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive
a bone marrow transplant. Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the “boy in the bubble,” who
was treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his death
from infection in 1984. One of the features that make bone marrow transplants work as well as they do is the proliferative
capability of hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. Only a small amount of bone marrow from a healthy donor is
given intravenously to the recipient. It finds its own way to the bone where it populates it, eventually reconstituting the
patient’s immune system, which is usually destroyed beforehand by treatment with radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs.

New treatments for SCID using gene therapy, inserting nondefective genes into cells taken from the patient and giving
them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants. Although not a standard
treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow transplantation has failed.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS

Although many viruses cause suppression of the immune system, only one wipes it out completely, and that is the previously
mentioned HIV. It is worth discussing the biology of this virus, which can lead to the well-known AIDS, so that its full
effects on the immune system can be understood. The virus is transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids, and blood, and
can be caught by risky sexual behaviors and the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users. There are sometimes, but not
always, flu-like symptoms in the first 1 to 2 weeks after infection. This is later followed by seroconversion. The anti-HIV
antibodies formed during seroconversion are the basis for most initial HIV screening done in the United States. Because
seroconversion takes different lengths of time in different individuals, multiple AIDS tests are given months apart to confirm
or eliminate the possibility of infection.

After seroconversion, the amount of virus circulating in the blood drops and stays at a low level for several years.

During this time, the levels of CD4* cells, especially helper T cells, decline steadily, until at some point, the immune
response is so weak that opportunistic disease and eventually death result. CD4 is the receptor that HIV uses to get inside T

cells and reproduce. Given that CD4* helper T cells play an important role in other in T cell immune responses and antibody
responses, it should be no surprise that both types of immune responses are eventually seriously compromised.

Treatment for the disease consists of drugs that target virally encoded proteins that are necessary for viral replication
but are absent from normal human cells. By targeting the virus itself and sparing the cells, this approach has been successful
in significantly prolonging the lives of HIV-positive individuals. On the other hand, an HIV vaccine has been 30 years in
development and is still years away. Because the virus mutates rapidly to evade the immune system, scientists have been
looking for parts of the virus that do not change and thus would be good targets for a vaccine candidate.

Hypersensitivities

The word “hypersensitivity” simply means sensitive beyond normal levels of activation. Allergies and inflammatory
responses to nonpathogenic environmental substances have been observed since the dawn of history. Hypersensitivity is a
medical term describing symptoms that are now known to be caused by unrelated mechanisms of immunity. Still, it is useful
for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand these mechanisms (Figure 21.28).

Figure 21.28 Immune Hypersensitivity Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity.
Notice that types I-III are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon.

Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity

Antigens that cause allergic responses are often referred to as allergens. The specificity of the immediate hypersensitivity
response is predicated on the binding of allergen-specific IgE to the mast cell surface. The process of producing allergen-
specific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity to
occur. Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is caused by the crosslinking of the
antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. The mediators released have various vasoactive effects already
discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal edema and runny nose caused by the increased
vascular permeability and increased blood flow of nasal blood vessels. As these mediators are released with mast cell
degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and occur within just a few minutes, hence the term
immediate hypersensitivity.

Most allergens are in themselves nonpathogenic and therefore innocuous. Some individuals develop mild allergies,
which are usually treated with antihistamines. Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock, which
can potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated. This drop in blood pressure (shock) with accompanying
contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an allergen is eaten (for
example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or inhaled (asthma). Because
epinephrine raises blood pressure and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely used to counteract the effects of
anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving. Patients with known severe allergies are encouraged to keep automatic epinephrine
injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access to hospitals.

Allergists use skin testing to identify allergens in type I hypersensitivity. In skin testing, allergen extracts are injected
into the epidermis, and a positive result of a soft, pale swelling at the site surrounded by a red zone (called the wheal and
flare response), caused by the release of histamine and the granule mediators, usually occurs within 30 minutes. The soft
center is due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels and the redness is caused by the increased blood flow to the area that
results from the dilation of local blood vessels at the site.

Type Il and Type Ill Hypersensitivities

Type II hypersensitivity, which involves IgG-mediated lysis of cells by complement proteins, occurs during mismatched
blood transfusions and blood compatibility diseases such as erythroblastosis fetalis (see section on transplantation). Type
III hypersensitivity occurs with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where soluble antigens, mostly DNA and
other material from the nucleus, and antibodies accumulate in the blood to the point that the antigen and antibody precipitate
along blood vessel linings. These immune complexes often lodge in the kidneys, joints, and other organs where they can
activate complement proteins and cause inflammation.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 957

Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity

Delayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response. In delayed
hypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary cellular
response results, secreting cytokines that recruit macrophages and other phagocytes to the site. These sensitized T cells, of
the Th1 class, will also activate cytotoxic T cells. The time it takes for this reaction to occur accounts for the 24- to 72-hour
delay in development.

The classical test for delayed hypersensitivity is the tuberculin test for tuberculosis, where bacterial proteins from M.
tuberculosis are injected into the skin. A couple of days later, a positive test is indicated by a raised red area that is hard to
the touch, called an induration, which is a consequence of the cellular infiltrate, an accumulation of activated macrophages.
A positive tuberculin test means that the patient has been exposed to the bacteria and exhibits a cellular immune response
to it.

Another type of delayed hypersensitivity is contact sensitivity, where substances such as the metal nickel cause a red
and swollen area upon contact with the skin. The individual must have been previously sensitized to the metal. A much
more severe case of contact sensitivity is poison ivy, but many of the harshest symptoms of the reaction are associated with
the toxicity of its oils and are not T cell mediated.

Autoimmune Responses

The worst cases of the immune system over-reacting are autoimmune diseases. Somehow, tolerance breaks down and the
immune systems in individuals with these diseases begin to attack their own bodies, causing significant damage. The trigger
for these diseases is, more often than not, unknown, and the treatments are usually based on resolving the symptoms using
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids. These diseases can be localized and crippling, as in
rheumatoid arthritis, or diffuse in the body with multiple symptoms that differ in different individuals, as is the case with
systemic lupus erythematosus (Figure 21.29).

a rheumatoid arthritis sufferer is shown in the x-ray. (b) The diagram shows a variety of possible symptoms of systemic
lupus erythematosus.

Environmental triggers seem to play large roles in autoimmune responses. One explanation for the breakdown of
tolerance is that, after certain bacterial infections, an immune response to a component of the bacterium cross-reacts with
a self-antigen. This mechanism is seen in rheumatic fever, a result of infection with Streptococcus bacteria, which causes
strep throat. The antibodies to this pathogen’s M protein cross-react with an antigenic component of heart myosin, a major
contractile protein of the heart that is critical to its normal function. The antibody binds to these molecules and activates
complement proteins, causing damage to the heart, especially to the heart valves. On the other hand, some theories propose
that having multiple common infectious diseases actually prevents autoimmune responses. The fact that autoimmune
diseases are rare in countries that have a high incidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the
hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in this chapter.

There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well. Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that
an individual expresses. The reason for this association is likely because if one’s MHC molecules are not able to present
a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur. Overall, there are more than 80 different
autoimmune diseases, which are a significant health problem in the elderly. Table 21.7 lists several of the most common
autoimmune diseases, the antigens that are targeted, and the segment of the adaptive immune response that causes the
damage.

21.7 | Transplantation and Cancer Immunology

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Explain why blood typing is important and what happens when mismatched blood is used in a transfusion
¢ Describe how tissue typing is done during organ transplantation and the role of transplant anti-rejection drugs

¢ Show how the immune response is able to control some cancers and how this immune response might be enhanced
by cancer vaccines

The immune responses to transplanted organs and to cancer cells are both important medical issues. With the use of tissue
typing and anti-rejection drugs, transplantation of organs and the control of the anti-transplant immune response have made
huge strides in the past 50 years. Today, these procedures are commonplace. Tissue typing is the determination of MHC
molecules in the tissue to be transplanted to better match the donor to the recipient. The immune response to cancer, on the
other hand, has been more difficult to understand and control. Although it is clear that the immune system can recognize
some cancers and control them, others seem to be resistant to immune mechanisms.

The Rh Factor

Red blood cells can be typed based on their surface antigens. ABO blood type, in which individuals are type A, B, AB, or
O according to their genetics, is one example. A separate antigen system seen on red blood cells is the Rh antigen. When
someone is “A positive” for example, the positive refers to the presence of the Rh antigen, whereas someone who is “A
negative” would lack this molecule.

An interesting consequence of Rh factor expression is seen in erythroblastosis fetalis, a hemolytic disease of the
newborn (Figure 21.30). This disease occurs when mothers negative for Rh antigen have multiple Rh-positive children.
During the birth of a first Rh-positive child, the mother makes a primary anti-Rh antibody response to the fetal blood cells
that enter the maternal bloodstream. If the mother has a second Rh-positive child, IgG antibodies against Rh-positive blood
mounted during this secondary response cross the placenta and attack the fetal blood, causing anemia. This is a consequence
of the fact that the fetus is not genetically identical to the mother, and thus the mother is capable of mounting an immune
response against it. This disease is treated with antibodies specific for Rh factor. These are given to the mother during the
subsequent births, destroying any fetal blood that might enter her system and preventing the immune response.

Figure 21.30 Erythroblastosis Fetalis Erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) is the result of
an immune response in an Rh-negative mother who has multiple children with an Rh-positive father. During the first
birth, fetal blood enters the mother’s circulatory system, and anti-Rh antibodies are made. During the gestation of the
second child, these antibodies cross the placenta and attack the blood of the fetus. The treatment for this disease is
to give the mother anti-Rh antibodies (RhoGAM) during the first pregnancy to destroy Rh-positive fetal red blood cells
from entering her system and causing the anti-Rh antibody response in the first place.

Tissue Transplantation

Tissue transplantation is more complicated than blood transfusions because of two characteristics of MHC molecules. These
molecules are the major cause of transplant rejection (hence the name “histocompatibility”). MHC polygeny refers to the
multiple MHC proteins on cells, and MHC polymorphism refers to the multiple alleles for each individual MHC locus.
Thus, there are many alleles in the human population that can be expressed (Table 21.8 and Table 21.9). When a donor
organ expresses MHC molecules that are different from the recipient, the latter will often mount a cytotoxic T cell response
to the organ and reject it. Histologically, if a biopsy of a transplanted organ exhibits massive infiltration of T lymphocytes
within the first weeks after transplant, it is a sign that the transplant is likely to fail. The response is a classical, and very
specific, primary T cell immune response. As far as medicine is concerned, the immune response in this scenario does the
patient no good at all and causes significant harm.

Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine A have made transplants more successful, but matching the MHC
molecules is still key. In humans, there are six MHC molecules that show the most polymorphisms, three class I molecules
(A, B, and C) and three class II molecules called DP, DQ, and DR. A successful transplant usually requires a match between
at least 3-4 of these molecules, with more matches associated with greater success. Family members, since they share a
similar genetic background, are much more likely to share MHC molecules than unrelated individuals do. In fact, due to
the extensive polymorphisms in these MHC molecules, unrelated donors are found only through a worldwide database. The
system is not foolproof however, as there are not enough individuals in the system to provide the organs necessary to treat
all patients needing them.

One disease of transplantation occurs with bone marrow transplants, which are used to treat various diseases, including
SCID and leukemia. Because the bone marrow cells being transplanted contain lymphocytes capable of mounting an
immune response, and because the recipient’s immune response has been destroyed before receiving the transplant, the
donor cells may attack the recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host disease. Symptoms of this disease, which usually
include a rash and damage to the liver and mucosa, are variable, and attempts have been made to moderate the disease by
first removing mature T cells from the donor bone marrow before transplanting it.

Immune Responses Against Cancer

It is clear that with some cancers, for example Kaposi’s sarcoma, a healthy immune system does a good job at controlling
them (Figure 21.31). This disease, which is caused by the human herpesvirus, is almost never observed in individuals with
strong immune systems, such as the young and immunocompetent. Other examples of cancers caused by viruses include
liver cancer caused by the hepatitis B virus and cervical cancer caused by the human papilloma virus. As these last two
viruses have vaccines available for them, getting vaccinated can help prevent these two types of cancer by stimulating the
immune response.

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 961

Figure 21.31 Karposi’s Sarcoma Lesions (credit: National Cancer Institute)

On the other hand, as cancer cells are often able to divide and mutate rapidly, they may escape the immune response,
just as certain pathogens such as HIV do. There are three stages in the immune response to many cancers: elimination,
equilibrium, and escape. Elimination occurs when the immune response first develops toward tumor-specific antigens
specific to the cancer and actively kills most cancer cells, followed by a period of controlled equilibrium during which
the remaining cancer cells are held in check. Unfortunately, many cancers mutate, so they no longer express any specific
antigens for the immune system to respond to, and a subpopulation of cancer cells escapes the immune response, continuing
the disease process.

This fact has led to extensive research in trying to develop ways to enhance the early immune response to completely
eliminate the early cancer and thus prevent a later escape. One method that has shown some success is the use of cancer
vaccines, which differ from viral and bacterial vaccines in that they are directed against the cells of one’s own body.
Treated cancer cells are injected into cancer patients to enhance their anti-cancer immune response and thereby prolong
survival. The immune system has the capability to detect these cancer cells and proliferate faster than the cancer cells
do, overwhelming the cancer in a similar way as they do for viruses. Cancer vaccines have been developed for malignant
melanoma, a highly fatal skin cancer, and renal (kidney) cell carcinoma. These vaccines are still in the development stages,
but some positive and encouraging results have been obtained clinically.

It is tempting to focus on the complexity of the immune system and the problems it causes as a negative. The upside
to immunity, however, is so much greater: The benefit of staying alive far outweighs the negatives caused when the system
does sometimes go awry. Working on “autopilot,” the immune system helps to maintain your health and kill pathogens. The
only time you really miss the immune response is when it is not being effective and illness results, or, as in the extreme case
of HIV disease, the immune system is gone completely.

962 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

Everyday CONNECTION

How Stress Affects the Immune Response: The Connections
between the Immune, Nervous, and Endocrine Systems of the
Body

The immune system cannot exist in isolation. After all, it has to protect the entire body from infection. Therefore, the
immune system is required to interact with other organ systems, sometimes in complex ways. Thirty years of research
focusing on the connections between the immune system, the central nervous system, and the endocrine system
have led to a new science with the unwieldy name of called psychoneuroimmunology. The physical connections
between these systems have been known for centuries: All primary and secondary organs are connected to sympathetic
nerves. What is more complex, though, is the interaction of neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and other
soluble signaling molecules, and the mechanism of “crosstalk” between the systems. For example, white blood cells,
including lymphocytes and phagocytes, have receptors for various neurotransmitters released by associated neurons.
Additionally, hormones such as cortisol (naturally produced by the adrenal cortex) and prednisone (synthetic) are well
known for their abilities to suppress T cell immune mechanisms, hence, their prominent use in medicine as long-term,
anti-inflammatory drugs.

One well-established interaction of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems is the effect of stress on immune
health. In the human vertebrate evolutionary past, stress was associated with the fight-or-flight response, largely
mediated by the central nervous system and the adrenal medulla. This stress was necessary for survival. The physical
action of fighting or running, whichever the animal decides, usually resolves the problem in one way or another. On
the other hand, there are no physical actions to resolve most modern day stresses, including short-term stressors like
taking examinations and long-term stressors such as being unemployed or losing a spouse. The effect of stress can be
felt by nearly every organ system, and the immune system is no exception (Table 21.10).

system

Table 21.10

At one time, it was assumed that all types of stress reduced all aspects of the immune response, but the last few
decades of research have painted a different picture. First, most short-term stress does not impair the immune system
in healthy individuals enough to lead to a greater incidence of diseases. However, older individuals and those with
suppressed immune responses due to disease or immunosuppressive drugs may respond even to short-term stressors
by getting sicker more often. It has been found that short-term stress diverts the body’s resources towards enhancing
innate immune responses, which have the ability to act fast and would seem to help the body prepare better for possible
infections associated with the trauma that may result from a fight-or-flight exchange. The diverting of resources away
from the adaptive immune response, however, causes its own share of problems in fighting disease.

Chronic stress, unlike short-term stress, may inhibit immune responses even in otherwise healthy adults. The
suppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses is clearly associated with increases in some diseases, as
seen when individuals lose a spouse or have other long-term stresses, such as taking care of a spouse with a fatal

CHAPTER REVIEW

21.1 Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems

The lymphatic system is a series of vessels, ducts, and trunks that remove interstitial fluid from the tissues and return it the
blood. The lymphatics are also used to transport dietary lipids and cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system
all come from the hematopoietic system of the bone marrow. Primary lymphoid organs, the bone marrow and thymus gland,
are the locations where lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system proliferate and mature. Secondary lymphoid organs are
site in which mature lymphocytes congregate to mount immune responses. Many immune system cells use the lymphatic
and circulatory systems for transport throughout the body to search for and then protect against pathogens.

21.2 Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response

Innate immune responses are critical to the early control of infections. Whereas barrier defenses are the body’s first line of
physical defense against pathogens, innate immune responses are the first line of physiological defense. Innate responses
occur rapidly, but with less specificity and effectiveness than the adaptive immune response. Innate responses can be caused
by a variety of cells, mediators, and antibacterial proteins such as complement. Within the first few days of an infection,
another series of antibacterial proteins are induced, each with activities against certain bacteria, including opsonization of
certain species. Additionally, interferons are induced that protect cells from viruses in their vicinity. Finally, the innate
immune response does not stop when the adaptive immune response is developed. In fact, both can cooperate and one can
influence the other in their responses against pathogens.

21.3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types

T cells recognize antigens with their antigen receptor, a complex of two protein chains on their surface. They do not
recognize self-antigens, however, but only processed antigen presented on their surfaces in a binding groove of a major
histocompatibility complex molecule. T cells develop in the thymus, where they learn to use self-MHC molecules to
recognize only foreign antigens, thus making them tolerant to self-antigens. There are several functional types of T
lymphocytes, the major ones being helper, regulatory, and cytotoxic T cells.

21.4 The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies

B cells, which develop within the bone marrow, are responsible for making five different classes of antibodies, each with
its own functions. B cells have their own mechanisms for tolerance, but in peripheral tolerance, the B cells that leave the
bone marrow remain inactive due to T cell tolerance. Some B cells do not need T cell cytokines to make antibody, and they
bypass this need by the crosslinking of their surface immunoglobulin by repeated carbohydrate residues found in the cell
walls of many bacterial species. Others require T cells to become activated.

21.5 The Immune Response against Pathogens

Early childhood is a time when the body develops much of its immunological memory that protects it from diseases in
adulthood. The components of the immune response that have the maximum effectiveness against a pathogen are often
associated with the class of pathogen involved. Bacteria and fungi are especially susceptible to damage by complement
proteins, whereas viruses are taken care of by interferons and cytotoxic T cells. Worms are attacked by eosinophils.
Pathogens have shown the ability, however, to evade the body’s immune responses, some leading to chronic infections or
even death. The immune system and pathogens are in a slow, evolutionary race to see who stays on top. Modern medicine,
hopefully, will keep the results skewed in humans’ favor.

21.6 Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses

The immune response can be under-reactive or over-reactive. Suppressed immunity can result from inherited genetic defects
or by acquiring viruses. Over-reactive immune responses include the hypersensitivities: B cell- and T cell-mediated immune
responses designed to control pathogens, but that lead to symptoms or medical complications. The worst cases of over-
reactive immune responses are autoimmune diseases, where an individual’s immune system attacks his or her own body
because of the breakdown of immunological tolerance. These diseases are more common in the aged, so treating them will
be a challenge in the future as the aged population in the world increases.

21.7 Transplantation and Cancer Immunology

Blood transfusion and organ transplantation both require an understanding of the immune response to prevent medical
complications. Blood needs to be typed so that natural antibodies against mismatched blood will not destroy it, causing
more harm than good to the recipient. Transplanted organs must be matched by their MHC molecules and, with the use of
immunosuppressive drugs, can be successful even if an exact tissue match cannot be made. Another aspect to the immune
response is its ability to control and eradicate cancer. Although this has been shown to occur with some rare cancers and

those caused by known viruses, the normal immune response to most cancers is not sufficient to control cancer growth.
Thus, cancer vaccines designed to enhance these immune responses show promise for certain types of cancer.
