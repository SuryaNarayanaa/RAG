17.3 The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus-pituitary complex is located in the diencephalon of the brain. The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland
are connected by a structure called the infundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve axons. The pituitary gland
is divided into two distinct structures with different embryonic origins. The posterior lobe houses the axon terminals of
hypothalamic neurons. It stores and releases into the bloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin and antidiuretic
hormone (ADH). The anterior lobe is connected to the hypothalamus by vasculature in the infundibulum and produces and
secretes six hormones. Their secretion is regulated, however, by releasing and inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus.
 The six anterior pituitary hormones are: growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL).

17.4 The Thyroid Gland

The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the neck anterior to the trachea.
