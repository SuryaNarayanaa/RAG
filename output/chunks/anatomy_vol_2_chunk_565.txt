Differentiate between primary, association, and integration areas of the cerebral cortex

¢ Provide examples of localization of function related to the cerebral cortex

In the clinical setting, the set of subtests known as the mental status exam helps us understand the relationship of the brain to
the body. Ultimately, this is accomplished by assessing behavior. Tremors related to intentional movements, incoordination,
or the neglect of one side of the body can be indicative of failures of the connections of the cerebrum either within the
hemispheres, or from the cerebrum to other portions of the nervous system. There is no strict test for what the cerebrum
does alone, but rather in what it does through its control of the rest of the CNS, the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and

the musculature.

 Sometimes eliciting a behavior is as simple as asking a question. Asking a patient to state his or her name is not only
to verify that the file folder in a health care provider’s hands is the correct one, but also to be sure that the patient is aware,
oriented, and capable of interacting with another person.
