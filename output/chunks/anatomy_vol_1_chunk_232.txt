Once glucose
is phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.

KEY TERMS
acid compound that releases hydrogen ions (H”) in solution

1-2-1 ratio

catalyst substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being changed in the process
cation atom with a positive charge

chemical energy form of energy that is absorbed as chemical bonds form, stored as they are maintained, and released
as they are broken

colloid liquid mixture in which the solute particles consist of clumps of molecules large enough to scatter light
compound substance composed of two or more different elements joined by chemical bonds

concentration number of particles within a given space

covalent bond chemical bond in which two atoms share electrons, thereby completing their valence shells

decomposition reaction type of catabolic reaction in which one or more bonds within a larger molecule are broken,
resulting in the release of smaller molecules or atoms

denaturation change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) deoxyribose-containing nucleotide that stores genetic information
disaccharide pair of carbohydrate monomers bonded by dehydration synthesis via a glycosidic bond

disulfide bond covalent bond formed within a polypeptide between sulfide groups of sulfur-containing amino acids,
for example, cysteine

electron shell area of space a given distance from an atom’s nucleus in which electrons are grouped
electron subatomic particle having a negative charge and nearly no mass; found orbiting the atom’s nucleus
element substance that cannot be created or broken down by ordinary chemical means

enzyme protein or RNA that catalyzes chemical reactions

exchange reaction type of chemical reaction in which bonds are both formed and broken, resulting in the transfer of
components

attracted to a second electronegative atom

inorganic compound substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen

ionic bond attraction between an anion and a cation

ion atom with an overall positive or negative charge

isotope one of the variations of an element in which the number of neutrons differ from each other
kinetic energy energy that matter possesses because of its motion

lipid class of nonpolar organic compounds built from hydrocarbons and distinguished by the fact that they are not
