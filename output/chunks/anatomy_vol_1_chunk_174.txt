This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the compounds
important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or organic.
 ¢ An inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many inorganic
compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced by your
stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of
the few examples.
 ¢ An organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are
synthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and hydrogen
are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two elements
combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the chemicals that fuel your
functioning.
