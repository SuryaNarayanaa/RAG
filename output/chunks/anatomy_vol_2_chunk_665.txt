It is divided
into five major sections that each deal with a specific region of the CNS. The mental status exam is concerned with the
cerebrum and assesses higher functions such as memory, language, and emotion. The cranial nerve exam tests the functions
of all of the cranial nerves and, therefore, their connections to the CNS through the forebrain and brain stem. The sensory
and motor exams assess those functions as they relate to the spinal cord, as well as the combination of the functions in spinal
reflexes. The coordination exam targets cerebellar function in coordinated movements, including those functions associated
with gait.

 Damage to and disease of the nervous system lead to loss of function. The location of the injury will correspond to the
functional loss, as suggested by the principle of localization of function. The neurological exam provides the opportunity
for a clinician to determine where damage has occurred on the basis of the function that is lost.
