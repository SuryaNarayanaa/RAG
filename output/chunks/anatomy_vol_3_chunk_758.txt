gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) hormone released by the hypothalamus that regulates the production of
follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland

labia majora hair-covered folds of skin located behind the mons pubis

labia minora thin, pigmented, hairless flaps of skin located medial and deep to the labia majora

lactiferous sinus area of milk collection between alveoli and lactiferous duct

Mullerian duct duct system present in the embryo that will eventually form the internal female reproductive structures
mammary glands glands inside the breast that secrete milk

menarche first menstruation in a pubertal female

menses phase phase of the menstrual cycle in which the endometrial lining is shed

menses shedding of the inner portion of the endometrium out though the vagina; also referred to as menstruation

menstrual cycle approximately 28-day cycle of changes in the uterus consisting of a menses phase, a proliferative
phase, and a secretory phase

mons pubis mound of fatty tissue located at the front of the vulva

myometrium smooth muscle layer of uterus that allows for uterine contractions during labor and expulsion of
menstrual blood

oocyte cell that results from the division of the oogonium and undergoes meiosis I at the LH surge and meiosis II at
fertilization to become a haploid ovum

oogenesis process by which oogonia divide by mitosis to primary oocytes, which undergo meiosis to produce the
secondary oocyte and, upon fertilization, the ovum

oogonia ovarian stem cells that undergo mitosis during female fetal development to form primary oocytes

ovarian cycle approximately 28-day cycle of changes in the ovary consisting of a follicular phase and a luteal phase
ovaries female gonads that produce oocytes and sex steroid hormones (notably estrogen and progesterone)
ovulation release of a secondary oocyte and associated granulosa cells from an ovary

ovum haploid female gamete resulting from completion of meiosis II at fertilization

penis male organ of copulation

perimetrium outer epithelial layer of uterine wall

polar body smaller cell produced during the process of meiosis in oogenesis

prepuce (also, foreskin) flap of skin that forms a collar around, and thus protects and lubricates, the glans penis; also
referred as the foreskin

primary follicles ovarian follicles with a primary oocyte and one layer of cuboidal granulosa cells

primordial follicles least developed ovarian follicles that consist of a single oocyte and a single layer of flat
(squamous) granulosa cells
