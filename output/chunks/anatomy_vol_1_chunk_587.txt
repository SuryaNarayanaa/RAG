This process is called modeling.

 Bone Remodeling

The process in which matrix is resorbed on one surface of a bone and deposited on another is known as bone modeling.
 Modeling primarily takes place during a bone’s growth. However, in adult life, bone undergoes remodeling, in which
resorption of old or damaged bone takes place on the same surface where osteoblasts lay new bone to replace that which
is resorbed. Injury, exercise, and other activities lead to remodeling. Those influences are discussed later in the chapter, but
even without injury or exercise, about 5 to 10 percent of the skeleton is remodeled annually just by destroying old bone and
renewing it with fresh bone.

Skeletal System

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease in which bones do not form properly and therefore are fragile and
break easily.
