The pericardial
sac consists of two fused layers: an outer fibrous capsule and an inner parietal pericardium lined with a serous membrane.
 Between the pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial cavity, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid. The walls of
the heart are composed of an outer epicardium, a thick myocardium, and an inner lining layer of endocardium. The human
heart consists of a pair of atria, which receive blood and pump it into a pair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels.
 The right atrium receives systemic blood relatively low in oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle, which pumps it into
the pulmonary circuit. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the lungs, and blood high in oxygen returns to the
left atrium, which pumps blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps blood into the aorta and the remainder of the
systemic circuit.
