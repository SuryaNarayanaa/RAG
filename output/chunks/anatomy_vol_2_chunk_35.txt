The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems

The nervous system can be divided into two major regions: the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous
system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else (Figure 12.2).
 The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral cavity
of the vertebral column. It is a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside these two cavities and
the peripheral nervous system is outside of them, but that is one way to start to think about it. In actuality, there are some
elements of the peripheral nervous system that are within the cranial or vertebral cavities. The peripheral nervous system is
so named because it is on the periphery—meaning beyond the brain and spinal cord. Depending on different aspects of the
nervous system, the dividing line between central and peripheral is not necessarily universal.
