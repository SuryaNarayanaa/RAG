It serves to support the body, protect the
brain and other internal organs, and provides a rigid structure upon which muscles can pull to generate body movements.
 It also stores fat and the tissue responsible for the production of blood cells. The skeleton is subdivided into two parts. The
axial skeleton forms a vertical axis that includes the head, neck, back, and chest. It has 80 bones and consists of the skull,
vertebral column, and thoracic cage. The adult vertebral column consists of 24 vertebrae plus the sacrum and coccyx. The
thoracic cage is formed by 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum. The appendicular skeleton consists of 126 bones in the adult
and includes all of the bones of the upper and lower limbs plus the bones that anchor each limb to the axial skeleton.

 7.2 The Skull

The skull consists of the brain case and the facial bones. The brain case surrounds and protects the brain, which occupies
the cranial cavity inside the skull.
