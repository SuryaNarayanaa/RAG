This process occurs between days 23 and
28. The remainder of the heart development pattern includes development of septa and valves, and remodeling of the actual
chambers. Partitioning of the atria and ventricles by the interatrial septum, interventricular septum, and atrioventricular
septum is complete by the end of the fifth week, although the fetal blood shunts remain until birth or shortly after. The
atrioventricular valves form between weeks five and eight, and the semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine.
