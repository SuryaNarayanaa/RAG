Anemia is a deficiency of RBCs or hemoglobin, whereas polycythemia
is an excess of RBCs.

 18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets

Leukocytes function in body defenses. They squeeze out of the walls of blood vessels through emigration or diapedesis,
then may move through tissue fluid or become attached to various organs where they fight against pathogenic organisms,
diseased cells, or other threats to health. Granular leukocytes, which include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils,
originate with myeloid stem cells, as do the agranular monocytes. The other agranular leukocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T
cells, arise from the lymphoid stem cell line. The most abundant leukocytes are the neutrophils, which are first responders to
infections, especially with bacteria. About 20-30 percent of all leukocytes are lymphocytes, which are critical to the body’s
defense against specific threats. Leukemia and lymphoma are malignancies involving leukocytes. Platelets are fragments of
cells known as megakaryocytes that dwell within the bone marrow.
