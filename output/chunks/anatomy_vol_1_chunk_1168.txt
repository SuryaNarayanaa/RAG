11.4 | Axial Muscles of the Abdominal Wall and Thorax

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Identify the intrinsic skeletal muscles of the back and neck, and the skeletal muscles of the abdominal wall and
thorax
¢ Identify the movement and function of the intrinsic skeletal muscles of the back and neck, and the skeletal muscles
of the abdominal wall and thorax

It is a complex job to balance the body on two feet and walk upright. The muscles of the vertebral column, thorax, and
abdominal wall extend, flex, and stabilize different parts of the body’s trunk. The deep muscles of the core of the body help
maintain posture as well as carry out other functions. The brain sends out electrical impulses to these various muscle groups
to control posture by alternate contraction and relaxation. This is necessary so that no single muscle group becomes fatigued
too quickly. If any one group fails to function, body posture will be compromised.
