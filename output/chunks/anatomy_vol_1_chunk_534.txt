Calluses can
writing, playing string

instruments, or video games. A corn is a specialized form of callus. Corns form from abrasions on the skin that result from

an elliptical-type motion.

CHAPTER REVIEW

5.1 Layers of the Skin

The skin is composed of two major layers: a superficial epidermis and a deeper dermis.
