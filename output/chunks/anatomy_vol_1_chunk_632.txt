The skeleton consists of the bones of the body. For adults, there are 206 bones in the skeleton. Younger
individuals have higher numbers of bones because some bones fuse together during childhood and adolescence to form an
adult bone. The primary functions of the skeleton are to provide a rigid, internal structure that can support the weight of the
body against the force of gravity, and to provide a structure upon which muscles can act to produce movements of the body.
 The lower portion of the skeleton is specialized for stability during walking or running. In contrast, the upper skeleton has
greater mobility and ranges of motion, features that allow you to lift and carry objects or turn your head and trunk.

 In addition to providing for support and movements of the body, the skeleton has protective and storage functions. It
protects the internal organs, including the brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, and pelvic organs.
