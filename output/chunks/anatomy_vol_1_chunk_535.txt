The epidermis consists of several
layers beginning with the innermost (deepest) stratum basale (germinatum), followed by the stratum spinosum, stratum
granulosum, stratum lucidum (when present), and ending with the outermost layer, the stratum corneum. The topmost layer,
the stratum corneum, consists of dead cells that shed periodically and is progressively replaced by cells formed from the
basal layer. The stratum basale also contains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the pigment primarily responsible for
giving skin its color. Melanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum to protect cells from UV rays.

 The dermis connects the epidermis to the hypodermis, and provides strength and elasticity due to the presence of
collagen and elastin fibers. It has only two layers: the papillary layer with papillae that extend into the epidermis and the
lower, reticular layer composed of loose connective tissue. The hypodermis, deep to the dermis of skin, is the connective
tissue that connects the dermis to underlying structures; it also harbors adipose tissue for fat storage and protection.
