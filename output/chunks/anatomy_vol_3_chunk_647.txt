Alkalosis is characterized by a higher-than-normal pH. Metabolic alkalosis is problematic, as elevated pH and excess
bicarbonate are present. The pCOz2 would again be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, it would increase as
the body attempts to reestablish the proper ratios of bicarbonate and carbonic acid/CO2.

 Respiratory alkalosis is problematic, as CO2 deficiency is present in the bloodstream. The bicarbonate concentration
would be normal at first. When renal compensation occurs, however, the bicarbonate concentration in blood decreases as
the kidneys attempt to reestablish the proper ratios of bicarbonate and carbonic acid/COz by eliminating more bicarbonate
to bring the pH into the physiological range.

KEY TERMS

antidiuretic hormone (ADH) also known as vasopressin, a hormone that increases the volume of water reabsorbed
from the collecting tubules of the kidney

dehydration state of containing insufficient water in blood and other tissues
dihydroxyvitamin D active form of vitamin D required by the intestinal epithelial cells for the absorption of calcium
diuresis excess production of urine

extracellular fluid (ECF) fluid exterior to cells; includes the interstitial fluid, blood plasma, and fluids found in other
reservoirs in the body

fluid compartment fluid inside all cells of the body constitutes a compartment system that is largely segregated from
other systems

hydrostatic pressure pressure exerted by a fluid against a wall, caused by its own weight or pumping force
hypercalcemia abnormally increased blood levels of calcium

hypercapnia abnormally elevated blood levels of CO2

hyperchloremia higher-than-normal blood chloride levels

hyperkalemia higher-than-normal blood potassium levels

hypernatremia abnormal increase in blood sodium levels

hyperphosphatemia abnormally increased blood phosphate levels

hypocalcemia abnormally low blood levels of calcium

hypocapnia abnormally low blood levels of CO2

hypochloremia lower-than-normal blood chloride levels

hypokalemia abnormally decreased blood levels of potassium

hyponatremia lower-than-normal levels of sodium in the blood

hypophosphatemia abnormally low blood phosphate levels

interstitial fluid (IF) fluid in the small spaces between cells not contained within blood vessels
intracellular fluid (ICF) fluid in the cytosol of cells

metabolic acidosis condition wherein a deficiency of bicarbonate causes the blood to be overly acidic
metabolic alkalosis condition wherein an excess of bicarbonate causes the blood to be overly alkaline

plasma osmolality ratio of solutes to a volume of solvent in the plasma; plasma osmolality reflects a person’s state of
hydration

respiratory acidosis condition wherein an excess of carbonic acid or CO2 causes the blood to be overly acidic

respiratory alkalosis condition wherein a deficiency of carbonic acid/CO2 levels causes the blood to be overly
alkaline
