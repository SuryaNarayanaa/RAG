Metabolic Alkalosis: Primary Bicarbonate Excess

Metabolic alkalosis is the opposite of metabolic acidosis. It occurs when the blood is too alkaline (pH above 7.45) due to
too much bicarbonate (called primary bicarbonate excess).

 A transient excess of bicarbonate in the blood can follow ingestion of excessive amounts of bicarbonate, citrate,
or antacids for conditions such as stomach acid reflux—known as heartburn. Cushing’s disease, which is the chronic
hypersecretion of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary gland, can cause chronic metabolic
alkalosis. The oversecretion of ACTH results in elevated aldosterone levels and an increased loss of potassium by urinary
excretion. Other causes of metabolic alkalosis include the loss of hydrochloric acid from the stomach through vomiting,
potassium depletion due to the use of diuretics for hypertension, and the excessive use of laxatives.
