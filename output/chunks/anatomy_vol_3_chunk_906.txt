Embryonic organ structures that were primitive and nonfunctional develop to the point that the newborn
can survive in the outside world.

 28.4 Maternal Changes During Pregnancy, Labor, and Birth

Hormones (especially estrogens, progesterone, and hCG) secreted by the corpus luteum and later by the placenta are
responsible for most of the changes experienced during pregnancy. Estrogen maintains the pregnancy, promotes fetal
viability, and stimulates tissue growth in the mother and developing fetus. Progesterone prevents new ovarian follicles from
developing and suppresses uterine contractility.

 Pregnancy weight gain primarily occurs in the breasts and abdominal region. Nausea, heartburn, and frequent urination
are common during pregnancy. Maternal blood volume increases by 30 percent during pregnancy and respiratory minute
volume increases by 50 percent. The skin may develop stretch marks and melanin production may increase.

 Toward the late stages of pregnancy, a drop in progesterone and stretching forces from the fetus lead to increasing
uterine irritability and prompt labor.
