The metabolic rate
measures the amount of energy used to maintain life. An organism must ingest a sufficient amount of food to maintain its
metabolic rate if the organism is to stay alive for very long.

 Catabolic reactions break down larger molecules, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins from ingested food, into
their constituent smaller parts. They also include the breakdown of ATP, which releases the energy needed for metabolic
processes in all cells throughout the body.

 Anabolic reactions, or biosynthetic reactions, synthesize larger molecules from smaller constituent parts, using ATP as
the energy source for these reactions. Anabolic reactions build bone, muscle mass, and new proteins, fats, and nucleic acids.
 Oxidation-reduction reactions transfer electrons across molecules by oxidizing one molecule and reducing another, and
collecting the released energy to convert Pj and ADP into ATP. Errors in metabolism alter the processing of carbohydrates,
lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and can result in a number of disease states.
