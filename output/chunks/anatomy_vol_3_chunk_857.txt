Gastrointestinal and Urinary Adjustments

In adults, the gastrointestinal tract harbors bacterial flora—trillions of bacteria that aid in digestion, produce vitamins, and
protect from the invasion or replication of pathogens. In stark contrast, the fetal intestine is sterile. The first consumption of
breast milk or formula floods the neonatal gastrointestinal tract with beneficial bacteria that begin to establish the bacterial

flora

The fetal kidneys filter blood and produce urine, but the neonatal kidneys are still immature and inefficient at

concentrating urine. Therefore, newborns produce very dilute urine, making it particularly important for infants to obtain
sufficient fluids from breast milk or formula.
