Although one type of leukocyte called memory cells can survive for years,
most erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets normally live only a few hours to a few weeks. Thus, the body must form new
blood cells and platelets quickly and continuously. When you donate a unit of blood during a blood drive (approximately
475 mL, or about 1 pint), your body typically replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours, but it takes about 4 to 6
weeks to replace the blood cells. This restricts the frequency with which donors can contribute their blood. The process by
which this replacement occurs is called hemopoiesis, or hematopoiesis (from the Greek root haima- = “blood”; -poiesis =
“production”).

 Sites of Hemopoiesis

Prior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning with the yolk sac of the developing embryo,
and continuing in the fetal liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow.
