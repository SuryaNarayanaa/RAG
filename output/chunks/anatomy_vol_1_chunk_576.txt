For skeletal
development, the most common template is cartilage. During fetal development, a framework is laid down that determines
where bones will form. This framework is a flexible, semi-solid matrix produced by chondroblasts and consists of
hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, collagen fibers, and water. As the matrix surrounds and isolates chondroblasts, they are
called chondrocytes. Unlike most connective tissues, cartilage is avascular, meaning that it has no blood vessels supplying
nutrients and removing metabolic wastes. All of these functions are carried on by diffusion through the matrix. This is why
damaged cartilage does not repair itself as readily as most tissues do.

 Throughout fetal development and into childhood growth and development, bone forms on the cartilaginous matrix.
 By the time a fetus is born, most of the cartilage has been replaced with bone. Some additional cartilage will be replaced
throughout childhood, and some cartilage remains in the adult skeleton.
