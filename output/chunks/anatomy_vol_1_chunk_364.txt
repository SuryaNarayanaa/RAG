The nucleus is encased within a membrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers,
side-by-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-lined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into and out of
the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or more nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome synthesis. The nucleus houses
the genetic material of the cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely contained structure called chromatin within the
nucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a variety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to divide, the chromatin
coils tightly and condenses to form chromosomes.

 There is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your body. The result is billions of new cells being created each day.
 Before any cell is ready to divide, it must replicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will receive an exact copy of the
organism’s genome.
