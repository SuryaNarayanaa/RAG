During this period, male and female gonads
differentiate. The fetal circulatory system becomes much more specialized and efficient than its embryonic counterpart.
 It includes three shunts—the ductus venosus, the foramen ovale, and the ductus arteriosus—that enable it to bypass the
semifunctional liver and pulmonary circuit until after childbirth. The brain continues to grow and its structures differentiate.
 Facial features develop, the body elongates, and the skeleton ossifies. In the womb, the developing fetus moves, blinks,
practices sucking, and circulates amniotic fluid. The fetus grows from an embryo measuring approximately 3.3 cm (1.3 in)
and weighing 7 g (0.25 oz) to an infant measuring approximately 51 cm (20 in) and weighing an average of approximately
3.4 kg (7.5 lbs).
