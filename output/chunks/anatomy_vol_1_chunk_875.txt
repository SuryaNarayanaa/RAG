Joints are classified both structurally and functionally. Structural classifications of
joints take into account whether the adjacent bones are strongly anchored to each other by fibrous connective tissue or
cartilage, or whether the adjacent bones articulate with each other within a fluid-filled space called a joint cavity. Functional
classifications describe the degree of movement available between the bones, ranging from immobile, to slightly mobile,
to freely moveable joints. The amount of movement available at a particular joint of the body is related to the functional
requirements for that joint. Thus immobile or slightly moveable joints serve to protect internal organs, give stability to the
body, and allow for limited body movement. In contrast, freely moveable joints allow for much more extensive movements
of the body and limbs.

 Structural Classification of Joints

The structural classification of joints is based on whether the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones are directly
connected by fibrous connective tissue or cartilage, or whether the articulating surfaces contact each other within a fluid-
filled joint cavity.
