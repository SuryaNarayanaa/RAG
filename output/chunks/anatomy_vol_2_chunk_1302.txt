20.3 Capillary Exchange

Small molecules can cross into and out of capillaries via simple or facilitated diffusion. Some large molecules can cross
in vesicles or through clefts, fenestrations, or gaps between cells in capillary walls. However, the bulk flow of capillary
and tissue fluid occurs via filtration and reabsorption. Filtration, the movement of fluid out of the capillaries, is driven by
the CHP. Reabsorption, the influx of tissue fluid into the capillaries, is driven by the BCOP. Filtration predominates in the
arterial end of the capillary; in the middle section, the opposing pressures are virtually identical so there is no net exchange,
whereas reabsorption predominates at the venule end of the capillary. The hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures in the
interstitial fluid are negligible in healthy circumstances.

20.4 Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System

Neural, endocrine, and autoregulatory mechanisms affect blood flow, blood pressure, and eventually perfusion of blood to
body tissues.
