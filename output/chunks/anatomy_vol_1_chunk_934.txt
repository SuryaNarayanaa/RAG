Discuss the movements available at each joint
¢ Describe the structures that support and prevent excess movements at each joint

Each synovial joint of the body is specialized to perform certain movements. The movements that are allowed are
determined by the structural classification for each joint. For example, a multiaxial ball-and-socket joint has much more
mobility than a uniaxial hinge joint. However, the ligaments and muscles that support a joint may place restrictions on the
total range of motion available. Thus, the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder has little in the way of ligament support,
which gives the shoulder a very large range of motion. In contrast, movements at the hip joint are restricted by strong
ligaments, which reduce its range of motion but confer stability during standing and weight bearing.

 This section will examine the anatomy of selected synovial joints of the body. Anatomical names for most joints are
derived from the names of the bones that articulate at that joint, although some joints, such as the elbow, hip, and knee joints
are exceptions to this general naming scheme.
