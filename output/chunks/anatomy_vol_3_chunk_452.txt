Rather than start with urine formation, this section will start with urine excretion. Urine is a fluid of variable composition
that requires specialized structures to remove it from the body safely and efficiently. Blood is filtered, and the filtrate is
transformed into urine at a relatively constant rate throughout the day. This processed liquid is stored until a convenient time
for excretion. All structures involved in the transport and storage of the urine are large enough to be visible to the naked
eye. This transport and storage system not only stores the waste, but it protects the tissues from damage due to the wide
range of pH and osmolarity of the urine, prevents infection by foreign organisms, and for the male, provides reproductive
functions.
