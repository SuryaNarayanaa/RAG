Compact
bone is solid and has greater structural strength.

 Fluid Connective Tissue

Blood and lymph are fluid connective tissues. Cells circulate in a liquid extracellular matrix. The formed elements
circulating in blood are all derived from hematopoietic stem cells located in bone marrow (Figure 4.17). Erythrocytes, red
blood cells, transport oxygen and some carbon dioxide. Leukocytes, white blood cells, are responsible for defending against
potentially harmful microorganisms or molecules. Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting. Some white blood
cells have the ability to cross the endothelial layer that lines blood vessels and enter adjacent tissues. Nutrients, salts, and
wastes are dissolved in the liquid matrix and transported through the body.

 Lymph contains a liquid matrix and white blood cells. Lymphatic capillaries are extremely permeable, allowing
larger molecules and excess fluid from interstitial spaces to enter the lymphatic vessels. Lymph drains into blood vessels,
delivering molecules to the blood that could not otherwise directly enter the bloodstream.
