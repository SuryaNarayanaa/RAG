People with neither A nor B antigens
are designated blood type O. ABO blood types are genetically determined.

 Normally the body must be exposed to a foreign antigen before an antibody can be produced. This is not the case for
the ABO blood group. Individuals with type A blood—without any prior exposure to incompatible blood—have preformed
antibodies to the B antigen circulating in their blood plasma. These antibodies, referred to as anti-B antibodies, will cause
agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter erythrocytes with B antigens. Similarly, an individual with type B
blood has pre-formed anti-A antibodies. Individuals with type AB blood, which has both antigens, do not have preformed
antibodies to either of these. People with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes, but both anti-A and
anti-B antibodies circulate in their blood plasma.
