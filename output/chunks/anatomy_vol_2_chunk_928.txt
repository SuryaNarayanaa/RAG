Hemopoietic growth
‘actors, including erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, colony-stimulating factors, and interleukins, promote the proliferation
and differentiation of formed elements.

18.3 Erythrocytes

[he most abundant formed elements in blood, erythrocytes are red, biconcave disks packed with an oxygen-carrying
compound called hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins bound to a pigment molecule called
heme, which contains an ion of iron. In the bloodstream, iron picks up oxygen in the lungs and drops it off in the tissues;
the amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Erythrocytes live only 120
days on average, and thus must be continually replaced. Worn-out erythrocytes are phagocytized by macrophages and their
hemoglobin is broken down. The breakdown products are recycled or removed as wastes: Globin is broken down into amino
acids for synthesis of new proteins; iron is stored in the liver or spleen or used by the bone marrow for production of new
erythrocytes; and the remnants of heme are converted into bilirubin, or other waste products that are taken up by the liver
and excreted in the bile or removed by the kidneys.
