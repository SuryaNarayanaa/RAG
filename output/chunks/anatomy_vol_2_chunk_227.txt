Explain the production of cerebrospinal fluid and its flow through the ventricles
¢ Explain how a disruption in circulation would result in a stroke

The CNS is crucial to the operation of the body, and any compromise in the brain and spinal cord can lead to severe
difficulties. The CNS has a privileged blood supply, as suggested by the blood-brain barrier. The function of the tissue in
the CNS is crucial to the survival of the organism, so the contents of the blood cannot simply pass into the central nervous
tissue. To protect this region from the toxins and pathogens that may be traveling through the blood stream, there is strict
control over what can move out of the general systems and into the brain and spinal cord. Because of this privilege, the CNS
needs specialized structures for the maintenance of circulation. This begins with a unique arrangement of blood vessels
carrying fresh blood into the CNS. Beyond the supply of blood, the CNS filters that blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
which is then circulated through the cavities of the brain and spinal cord called ventricles.
