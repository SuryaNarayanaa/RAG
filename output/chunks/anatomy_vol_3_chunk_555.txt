Acute kidney injury can be caused by a number of factors, including transplants and other surgeries. It affects
7-10 percent of all hospitalized patients, resulting in the deaths of 35-40 percent of inpatients. In limited studies using
mesenchymal stem cells, there have been fewer instances of kidney damage after surgery, the length of hospital stays
has been reduced, and there have been fewer readmissions after release.

 How do these stem cells work to protect or repair the kidney? Scientists are unsure at this point, but some evidence
has shown that these stem cells release several growth factors in endocrine and paracrine ways. As further studies are
conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of stem cell therapy, we will move closer to a day when kidney injury
is rare, and curative treatments are routine.

CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM 1165

KEY TERMS

anatomical sphincter smooth or skeletal muscle surrounding the lumen of a vessel or hollow organ that can restrict
flow when contracted

angiotensin Il protein produced by the enzymatic action of ACE on inactive angiotensin I; actively causes
vasoconstriction and stimulates aldosterone release by the adrenal cortex

angiotensin | protein produced by the enzymatic action of renin on angiotensinogen; inactive precursor of angiotensin
Il

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) enzyme produced by the lungs that catalyzes the reaction of inactive
angiotensin I into active angiotensin IT

angiotensinogen inactive protein in the circulation produced by the liver; precursor of angiotensin I; must be
modified by the enzymes renin and ACE to be activated

anuria absence of urine produced; production of 50 mL or less per day

aquaporin protein-forming water channels through the lipid bilayer of the cell; allows water to cross; activation in the
collecting ducts is under the control of ADH

Bowman’s capsule cup-shaped sack lined by a simple squamous epithelium (parietal surface) and specialized cells
called podocytes (visceral surface) that participate in the filtration process; receives the filtrate which then passes on

to the PCTs

brush border formed by microvilli on the surface of certain cuboidal cells; in the kidney it is found in the PCT;
increases surface area for absorption in the kidney

calyces cup-like structures receiving urine from the collecting ducts where it passes on to the renal pelvis and ureter
cortical nephrons nephrons with loops of Henle that do not extend into the renal medulla

countercurrent multiplier system involves the descending and ascending loops of Henle directing forming urine in
opposing directions to create a concentration gradient when combined with variable permeability and sodium
pumping

detrusor muscle smooth muscle in the bladder wall; fibers run in all directions to reduce the size of the organ when
emptying it of urine

distal convoluted tubules portions of the nephron distal to the loop of Henle that receive hyposmotic filtrate from
the loop of Henle and empty into collecting ducts

diuretic compound that increases urine output, leading to decreased water conservation

efferent arteriole arteriole carrying blood from the glomerulus to the capillary beds around the convoluted tubules and
loop of Henle; portion of the portal system

endothelins group of vasoconstrictive, 21-amino acid peptides; produced by endothelial cells of the renal blood
vessels, mesangial cells, and cells of the DCT

external urinary sphincter skeletal muscle; must be relaxed consciously to void urine

fenestrations small windows through a cell, allowing rapid filtration based on size; formed in such a way as to allow
substances to cross through a cell without mixing with cell contents

filtration slits formed by pedicels of podocytes; substances filter between the pedicels based on size
forming urine filtrate undergoing modifications through secretion and reabsorption before true urine is produced
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) rate of renal filtration

glomerulus tuft of capillaries surrounded by Bowman’s capsule; filters the blood based on size

1166 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM

glycosuria presence of glucose in the urine; caused by high blood glucose levels that exceed the ability of the kidneys
to reabsorb the glucose; usually the result of untreated or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus

incontinence loss of ability to control micturition

intercalated cell specialized cell of the collecting ducts that secrete or absorb acid or bicarbonate; important in
acid-base balance

internal urinary sphincter smooth muscle at the juncture of the bladder and urethra; relaxes as the bladder fills to
allow urine into the urethra

inulin plant polysaccharide injected to determine GFR; is neither secreted nor absorbed by the kidney, so its appearance
in the urine is directly proportional to its filtration rate

juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) located at the juncture of the DCT and the afferent and efferent arterioles of the
glomerulus; plays a role in the regulation of renal blood flow and GFR

juxtaglomerular cell modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole; secretes renin in response to a drop in
blood pressure

juxtamedullary nephrons nephrons adjacent to the border of the cortex and medulla with loops of Henle that extend
into the renal medulla

leaky tight junctions tight junctions in which the sealing strands of proteins between the membranes of adjacent cells
are fewer in number and incomplete; allows limited intercellular movement of solvent and solutes

leukocyte esterase enzyme produced by leukocytes that can be detected in the urine and that serves as an indirect
indicator of urinary tract infection

loop of Henle descending and ascending portions between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules; those of cortical
nephrons do not extend into the medulla, whereas those of juxtamedullary nephrons do extend into the medulla

macula densa cells found in the part of the DCT forming the JGA; sense Na* concentration in the forming urine
medulla inner region of kidney containing the renal pyramids

mesangial contractile cells found in the glomerulus; can contract or relax to regulate filtration rate

micturition also called urination or voiding

myogenic mechanism mechanism by which smooth muscle responds to stretch by contracting; an increase in blood
pressure causes vasoconstriction and a decrease in blood pressure causes vasodilation so that blood flow
downstream remains steady

nephrons functional units of the kidney that carry out all filtration and modification to produce urine; consist of renal
corpuscles, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and descending and ascending loops of Henle; drain into
collecting ducts

net filtration pressure (NFP) pressure of fluid across the glomerulus; calculated by taking the hydrostatic pressure of
the capillary and subtracting the colloid osmotic pressure of the blood and the hydrostatic pressure of Bowman’s
capsule

oliguria below normal urine production of 400-500 mL/day

osteomalacia softening of bones due to a lack of mineralization with calcium and phosphate; most often due to lack of
vitamin D; in children, osteomalacia is termed rickets; not to be confused with osteoporosis

pedicels finger-like projections of podocytes surrounding glomerular capillaries; interdigitate to form a filtration
membrane

peritubular capillaries second capillary bed of the renal portal system; surround the proximal and distal convoluted
tubules; associated with the vasa recta

physiological sphincter sphincter consisting of circular smooth muscle indistinguishable from adjacent muscle but
possessing differential innervations, permitting its function as a sphincter; structurally weak

large areas of the body, particularly the lower extremities

trigone area at the base of the bladder marked by the two ureters in the posterior—lateral aspect and the urethral orifice in
the anterior aspect oriented like points on a triangle

tubuloglomerular feedback feedback mechanism involving the JGA; macula densa cells monitor Na* concentration
in the terminal portion of the ascending loop of Henle and act to cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation of afferent
and efferent arterioles to alter GFR

urethra transports urine from the bladder to the outside environment
urinalysis analysis of urine to diagnose disease
urochrome heme-derived pigment that imparts the typical yellow color of urine

vasa recta branches of the efferent arterioles that parallel the course of the loops of Henle and are continuous with the
