That is actually a variation of the mental status subtest of repeating the months backwards. However, the
cerebellum is important because speech production is a coordinated activity. The speech rapid alternating movement
subtest is specifically using the consonant changes of “lah-kah-pah” to assess coordinated movements of the lips,
tongue, pharynx, and palate. But the entire alphabet, especially in the nonrehearsed backwards order, pushes this type
of coordinated movement quite far. It is related to the reason that speech becomes slurred when a person is intoxicated.

CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM 677

KEY TERMS
accommodation in vision, a change in the ability of the eye to focus on objects at different distances

accommodation-convergence reflex coordination of somatic control of the medial rectus muscles of either eye
with the parasympathetic control of the ciliary bodies to maintain focus while the eyes converge on visual stimuli
near to the face

aphasia loss of language function

ataxia movement disorder related to damage of the cerebellum characterized by loss of coordination in voluntary
movements

Babinski sign dorsiflexion of the foot with extension and splaying of the toes in response to the plantar reflex,
normally suppressed by corticospinal input

cerebrocerebellum lateral regions of the cerebellum; named for the significant input from the cerebral cortex
check reflex response to a release in resistance so that the contractions stop, or check, movement

clasp-knife response sign of UMN disease when a patient initially resists passive movement of a muscle but will
quickly release to a lower state of resistance

conduction aphasia loss of language function related to connecting the understanding of speech with the production
of speech, without either specific function being lost

conductive hearing hearing dependent on the conduction of vibrations of the tympanic membrane through the
ossicles of the middle ear

conjugate gaze coordinated movement of the two eyes simultaneously in the same direction

convergence in vision, the movement of the eyes so that they are both pointed at the same point in space, which
increases for stimuli that are closer to the subject

coordination exam major section of the neurological exam that assesses complex, coordinated motor functions of the
cerebellum and associated motor pathways

cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway projection from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum by way of the gray matter
of the pons

cranial nerve exam major section of the neurological exam that assesses sensory and motor functions of the cranial
nerves and their associated central and peripheral structures

cytoarchitecture study of a tissue based on the structure and organization of its cellular components; related to the
broader term, histology

deep tendon reflex another term for stretch reflex, based on the elicitation through deep stimulation of the tendon at
the insertion

diplopia double vision resulting from a failure in conjugate gaze
edema fluid accumulation in tissue; often associated with circulatory deficits

embolus obstruction in a blood vessel such as a blood clot, fatty mass, air bubble, or other foreign matter that interrupts
the flow of blood to an organ or some part of the body

episodic memory memory of specific events in an autobiographical sense

expressive aphasia loss of the ability to produce language; usually associated with damage to Broca’s area in the
frontal lobe

extrinsic muscles of the tongue muscles that are connected to other structures, such as the hyoid bone or the
mandible, and control the position of the tongue

678 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM

fasciculation small muscle twitch as a result of spontaneous activity from an LMN
fauces opening from the oral cavity into the pharynx

fibrillation in motor responses, a spontaneous muscle action potential that occurs in the absence of neuromuscular
input, resulting from LMN lesions

flaccid paralysis loss of voluntary muscle control and muscle tone, as the result of LMN disease
flaccidity presentation of a loss of muscle tone, observed as floppy limbs or a lack of resistance to passive movement

flocculonodular lobe lobe of the cerebellum that receives input from the vestibular system to help with balance and
posture

gait exam major section of the neurological exam that assesses the cerebellum and descending pathways in the spinal
cord through the coordinated motor functions of walking; a portion of the coordination exam

gait rhythmic pattern of alternating movements of the lower limbs during locomotion

gnosis in a neurological exam, intuitive experiential knowledge tested by interacting with common objects or symbols
graphesthesia perception of symbols, such as letters or numbers, traced in the palm of the hand

hemisection cut through half of a structure, such as the spinal cord

hemorrhagic stroke disruption of blood flow to the brain caused by bleeding within the cranial vault

hyperflexia overly flexed joints

hypotonicity low muscle tone, a sign of LMN disease

hypovolemia decrease in blood volume

inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) input to the cerebellum, largely from the inferior olive, that represents sensory
feedback from the periphery

inferior olive large nucleus in the medulla that receives input from sensory systems and projects into the cerebellar
cortex

internuclear ophthalmoplegia deficit of conjugate lateral gaze because the lateral rectus muscle of one eye does not
contract resulting from damage to the abducens nerve or the MLF

intorsion medial rotation of the eye around its axis

intrinsic muscles of the tongue muscles that originate out of, and insert into, other tissues within the tongue and
control the shape of the tongue

ischemic stroke disruption of blood flow to the brain because blood cannot flow through blood vessels as a result of a
blockage or narrowing of the vessel

jaw-jerk reflex stretch reflex of the masseter muscle

localization of function principle that circumscribed anatomical locations are responsible for specific functions in an
organ system

medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) fiber pathway that connects structures involved in the control of eye and
head position, from the superior colliculus to the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum

mental status exam major section of the neurological exam that assesses cognitive functions of the cerebrum

middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) large, white-matter bridge from the pons that constitutes the major input to the
cerebellar cortex

motor exam major section of the neurological exam that assesses motor functions of the spinal cord and spinal nerves

neurological exam clinical assessment tool that can be used to quickly evaluate neurological function and determine
if specific parts of the nervous system have been affected by damage or disease
