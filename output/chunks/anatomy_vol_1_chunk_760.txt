The adult axial skeleton consists of 80 bones that form
the head and body trunk. Attached to this are the limbs, whose 126 bones constitute the appendicular skeleton. These bones
are divided into two groups: the bones that are located within the limbs themselves, and the girdle bones that attach the
limbs to the axial skeleton. The bones of the shoulder region form the pectoral girdle, which anchors the upper limb to the
thoracic cage of the axial skeleton. The lower limb is attached to the vertebral column by the pelvic girdle.


288 CHAPTER 8 | THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON

Because of our upright stance, different functional demands are placed upon the upper and lower limbs. Thus, the
bones of the lower limbs are adapted for weight-bearing support and stability, as well as for body locomotion via walking
or running. In contrast, our upper limbs are not required for these functions. Instead, our upper limbs are highly mobile and
can be utilized for a wide variety of activities.
