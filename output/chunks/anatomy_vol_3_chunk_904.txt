The
blastocyst implants in the uterine wall, the trophoblasts fuse to form a syncytiotrophoblast, and the conceptus is enveloped
by the endometrium. Four embryonic membranes form to support the growing embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the
allantois, and the chorion. The chorionic villi of the chorion extend into the endometrium to form the fetal portion of the
placenta. The placenta supplies the growing embryo with oxygen and nutrients; it also removes carbon dioxide and other
metabolic wastes.

 Following implantation, embryonic cells undergo gastrulation, in which they differentiate and separate into an
embryonic disc and establish three primary germ layers (the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Through the process of
embryonic folding, the fetus begins to take shape. Neurulation starts the process of the development of structures of the
central nervous system and organogenesis establishes the basic plan for all organ systems.

28.3 Fetal Development

The fetal period lasts from the ninth week of development until birth.
