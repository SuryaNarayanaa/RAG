Their morphologies match their specific functions in the
body. Skeletal muscle is voluntary and responds to conscious stimuli. The cells are striated and multinucleated appearing
as long, unbranched cylinders. Cardiac muscle is involuntary and found only in the heart. Each cell is striated with a single
nucleus and they attach to one another to form long fibers. Cells are attached to one another at intercalated disks. The cells
are interconnected physically and electrochemically to act as a syncytium. Cardiac muscle cells contract autonomously and
involuntarily. Smooth muscle is involuntary. Each cell is a spindle-shaped fiber and contains a single nucleus. No striations
are evident because the actin and myosin filaments do not align in the cytoplasm.

 4.5 Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response

The most prominent cell of the nervous tissue, the neuron, is characterized mainly by its ability to receive stimuli and
respond by generating an electrical signal, known as an action potential, which can travel rapidly over great distances in
the body.
