CHAPTER REVIEW

18.1 An Overview of Blood

Blood is a fluid connective tissue critical to the transportation of nutrients, gases, and wastes throughout the body; to
defend the body against infection and other threats; and to the homeostatic regulation of pH, temperature, and other internal
conditions.
