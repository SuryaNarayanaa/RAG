CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION

KEY TERMS
ATP synthase protein pore complex that creates ATP

absorptive state also called the fed state; the metabolic state occurring during the first few hours after ingesting food
in which the body is digesting food and absorbing the nutrients

acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) starting molecule of the Krebs cycle

anabolic hormones hormones that stimulate the synthesis of new, larger molecules
anabolic reactions reactions that build smaller molecules into larger molecules
basal metabolic rate (BMR) amount of energy expended by the body at rest

beta (B)-hydroxybutyrate primary ketone body produced in the body

beta (B)-oxidation fatty acid oxidation

bile salts salts that are released from the liver in response to lipid ingestion and surround the insoluble triglycerides to
aid in their conversion to monoglycerides and free fatty acids

biosynthesis reactions reactions that create new molecules, also called anabolic reactions

body mass index (BMI) relative amount of body weight compared to the overall height; a BMI ranging from 18-24.9
is considered normal weight, 25-29.9 is considered overweight, and greater than 30 is considered obese

calorie amount of heat required raise 1 g of water by 1 °C
catabolic hormones hormones that stimulate the breakdown of larger molecules
catabolic reactions reactions that break down larger molecules into their constituent parts

cellular respiration production of ATP from glucose oxidation via glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative
phosphorylation

cholecystokinin (CCK) hormone that stimulates the release of pancreatic lipase and the contraction of the gallbladder
to release bile salts

chylomicrons vesicles containing cholesterol and triglycerides that transport lipids out of the intestinal cells and into
the lymphatic and circulatory systems

chymotrypsin pancreatic enzyme that digests protein
chymotrypsinogen proenzyme that is activated by trypsin into chymotrypsin

citric acid cycle also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle; converts pyruvate into CO2 and high-
energy FADH2, NADH, and ATP molecules

conduction transfer of heat through physical contact
convection transfer of heat between the skin and air or water
elastase pancreatic enzyme that digests protein

electron transport chain (ETC) ATP production pathway in which electrons are passed through a series of
oxidation-reduction reactions that forms water and produces a proton gradient

energy-consuming phase first phase of glycolysis, in which two molecules of ATP are necessary to start the reaction
energy-yielding phase second phase of glycolysis, during which energy is produced
enterokinase enzyme located in the wall of the small intestine that activates trypsin

evaporation transfer of heat that occurs when water changes from a liquid to a gas

FADHz2 high-energy molecule needed for glycolysis
fatty acid oxidation breakdown of fatty acids into smaller chain fatty acids and acetyl CoA
flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) coenzyme used to produce FADH2

glucokinase cellular enzyme, found in the liver, which converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate upon uptake into the
cell

gluconeogenesis process of glucose synthesis from pyruvate or other molecules
glucose-6-phosphate phosphorylated glucose produced in the first step of glycolysis

glycogen form that glucose assumes when it is stored

glycolysis series of metabolic reactions that breaks down glucose into pyruvate and produces ATP

hexokinase cellular enzyme, found in most tissues, that converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate upon uptake into
the cell

hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) molecule created in the first step of the creation of ketone bodies from
acetyl CoA

inactive proenzymes forms in which proteases are stored and released to prevent the inappropriate digestion of the
native proteins of the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine

insulin hormone secreted by the pancreas that stimulates the uptake of glucose into the cells

Krebs cycle also called the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, converts pyruvate into CO2 and high-energy
FADH2, NADH, and ATP molecules

ketone bodies alternative source of energy when glucose is limited, created when too much acetyl CoA is created
during fatty acid oxidation

lipogenesis synthesis of lipids that occurs in the liver or adipose tissues

lipolysis breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids

metabolic rate amount of energy consumed minus the amount of energy expended by the body
metabolism sum of all catabolic and anabolic reactions that take place in the body

minerals inorganic compounds required by the body to ensure proper function of the body
monoglyceride molecules lipid consisting of a single fatty acid chain attached to a glycerol backbone
monosaccharide smallest, monomeric sugar molecule

NADH high-energy molecule needed for glycolysis

nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) coenzyme used to produce NADH

oxidation-reduction reaction (also, redox reaction) pair of reactions in which an electron is passed from one
molecule to another, oxidizing one and reducing the other

oxidation loss of an electron

oxidative phosphorylation process that converts high-energy NADH and FADH?
