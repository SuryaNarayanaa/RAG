The end of the muscle that attaches to the bone being pulled is called
the muscle’s insertion and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed, or stabilized, bone is called the origin. The muscle
primarily responsible for a movement is called the prime mover, and muscles that assist in this action are called synergists.
 A synergist that makes the insertion site more stable is called a fixator. Meanwhile, a muscle with the opposite action of
the prime mover is called an antagonist. Several factors contribute to the force generated by a skeletal muscle. One is the
arrangement of the fascicles in the skeletal muscle. Fascicles can be parallel, circular, convergent, pennate, fusiform, or
triangular. Each arrangement has its own range of motion and ability to do work.

11.2 Naming Skeletal Muscles

Muscle names are based on many characteristics. The location of a muscle in the body is important. Some muscles are
named based on their size and location, such as the gluteal muscles of the buttocks.
