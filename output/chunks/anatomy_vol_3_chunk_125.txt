It may also help the alveoli to form and mature. Fetal breathing
movements are considered a sign of robust health.

 Birth

Prior to birth, the lungs are filled with amniotic fluid, mucus, and surfactant. As the fetus is squeezed through the birth canal,
the fetal thoracic cavity is compressed, expelling much of this fluid. Some fluid remains, however, but is rapidly absorbed
by the body shortly after birth. The first inhalation occurs within 10 seconds after birth and not only serves as the first
inspiration, but also acts to inflate the lungs. Pulmonary surfactant is critical for inflation to occur, as it reduces the surface
tension of the alveoli. Preterm birth around 26 weeks frequently results in severe respiratory distress, although with current
medical advancements, some babies may survive. Prior to 26 weeks, sufficient pulmonary surfactant is not produced, and
the surfaces for gas exchange have not formed adequately; therefore, survival is low.
