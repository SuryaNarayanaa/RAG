The synovial joints
will form between the adjacent cartilage models, in an area called the joint interzone. Cells at the center of this interzone
region undergo cell death to form the joint cavity, while surrounding mesenchyme cells will form the articular capsule
and supporting ligaments. The process of endochondral ossification, which converts the cartilage models into bone, begins
by the twelfth week of embryonic development. At birth, ossification of much of the bone has occurred, but the hyaline
cartilage of the epiphyseal plate will remain throughout childhood and adolescence to allow for bone lengthening. Hyaline
cartilage is also retained as the articular cartilage that covers the surfaces of the bones at synovial joints.
