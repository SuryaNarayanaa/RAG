A loss of renal function means a loss of effective vascular volume
control, leading to hypotension (low blood pressure) or hypertension (high blood pressure), which can lead to stroke, heart
attack, and aneurysm formation.

 The kidneys cooperate with the lungs, liver, and adrenal cortex through the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone system (see
Figure 25.14). The liver synthesizes and secretes the inactive precursor angiotensinogen. When the blood pressure is low,
the kidney synthesizes and releases renin. Renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, and ACE produced in the
lung converts angiotensin I into biologically active angiotensin II (Figure 25.23). The immediate and short-term effect of
angiotensin II is to raise blood pressure by causing widespread vasoconstriction. angiotensin II also stimulates the adrenal

cortex to release the steroid hormone aldosterone, which results in renal reabsorption of Na’ and its associated osmotic

recovery of water.
