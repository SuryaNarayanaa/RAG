It is initiated by the contraction of the ventricles of the heart. Ventricular contraction ejects blood
into the major arteries, resulting in flow from regions of higher pressure to regions of lower pressure, as blood encounters
smaller arteries and arterioles, then capillaries, then the venules and veins of the venous system. This section discusses a
number of critical variables that contribute to blood flow throughout the body. It also discusses the factors that impede or
slow blood flow, a phenomenon known as resistance.

 As noted earlier, hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by a fluid due to gravitational pull, usually against the wall
of the container in which it is located. One form of hydrostatic pressure is blood pressure, the force exerted by blood upon
the walls of the blood vessels or the chambers of the heart. Blood pressure may be measured in capillaries and veins, as
well as the vessels of the pulmonary circulation; however, the term blood pressure without any specific descriptors typically
refers to systemic arterial blood pressure—that is, the pressure of blood flowing in the arteries of the systemic circulation.
