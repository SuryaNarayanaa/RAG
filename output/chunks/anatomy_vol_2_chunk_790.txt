An example of a hormone secreted by the stomach cells
is gastrin, a peptide hormone secreted in response to stomach distention that stimulates the release of hydrochloric acid.
 Secretin is a peptide hormone secreted by the small intestine as acidic chyme (partially digested food and fluid) moves from
the stomach. It stimulates the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas, which buffers the acidic chyme, and inhibits the
further secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is another peptide hormone released from the
small intestine. It promotes the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and the release of bile from the gallbladder, both of which
facilitate digestion. Other hormones produced by the intestinal cells aid in glucose metabolism, such as by stimulating the
pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin, reducing glucagon secretion from the alpha cells, or enhancing cellular sensitivity to
insulin.
