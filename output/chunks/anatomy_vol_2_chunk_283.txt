13.4 The Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS is composed of the groups of neurons (ganglia) and bundles of axons (nerves) that are outside of the brain and
spinal cord. Ganglia are of two types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain unipolar sensory neurons and are
found on the dorsal root of all spinal nerves as well as associated with many of the cranial nerves. Autonomic ganglia are in
the sympathetic chain, the associated paravertebral or prevertebral ganglia, or in terminal ganglia near or within the organs
controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

 Nerves are classified as cranial nerves or spinal nerves on the basis of their connection to the brain or spinal cord,
respectively. The twelve cranial nerves can be strictly sensory in function, strictly motor in function, or a combination of the
two functions. Sensory fibers are axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information into the brain and target sensory
nuclei. Motor fibers are axons of motor neurons in motor nuclei of the brain stem and target skeletal muscles of the head
and neck.
