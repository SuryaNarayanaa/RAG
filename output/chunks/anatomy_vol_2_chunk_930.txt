While many platelets are stored in the spleen, others
enter the circulation and are essential for hemostasis; they also produce several growth factors important for repair and
healing.

 18.5 Hemostasis

Hemostasis is the physiological process by which bleeding ceases. Hemostasis involves three basic steps: vascular spasm,
the formation of a platelet plug, and coagulation, in which clotting factors promote the formation of a fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis
is the process in which a clot is degraded in a healing vessel. Anticoagulants are substances that oppose coagulation.
 They are important in limiting the extent and duration of clotting. Inadequate clotting can result from too few platelets,
or inadequate production of clotting factors, for instance, in the genetic disorder hemophilia. Excessive clotting, called
thrombosis, can be caused by excessive numbers of platelets. A thrombus is a collection of fibrin, platelets, and erythrocytes
that has accumulated along the lining of a blood vessel, whereas an embolus is a thrombus that has broken free from the
vessel wall and is circulating in the bloodstream.

18.6 Blood Typing

Antigens are nonself molecules, usually large proteins, which provoke an immune response.
