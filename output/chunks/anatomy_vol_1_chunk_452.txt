Epithelial tissues act as coverings controlling the movement of materials across the
surface. Connective tissue integrates the various parts of the body and provides support and protection to organs. Muscle
tissue allows the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate information.

 The study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the body derive
from three germ layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.

 Different types of tissues form membranes that enclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction between organs,
and keep organs together. Synovial membranes are connective tissue membranes that protect and line the joints. Epithelial
membranes are formed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of connective tissue. There are three types of epithelial
membranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous, which secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the skin.

4.2 Epithelial Tissue

In epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little or no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina that separates
the epithelium from underlying tissue.
