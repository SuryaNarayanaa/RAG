Cell differentiation is the process of cells becoming
specialized as they body develops. A stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can,
under specific conditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into several categories according to
their potential to differentiate. While all somatic cells contain the exact same genome, different cell types only express some
of those genes at any given time. These differences in gene expression ultimately dictate a cell’s unique morphological and
physiological characteristics. The primary mechanism that determines which genes will be expressed and which ones will
not is through the use of different transcription factor proteins, which bind to DNA and promote or hinder the transcription
of different genes. Through the action of these transcription factors, cells specialize into one of hundreds of different cell
types in the human body.
