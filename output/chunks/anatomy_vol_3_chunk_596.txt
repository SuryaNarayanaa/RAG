Although most of the
intake comes through the digestive tract, about 230 mL (8 ounces) per day is generated metabolically, in the last steps
of aerobic respiration. Additionally, each day about the same volume (2500 mL) of water leaves the body by different
routes; most of this lost water is removed as urine. The kidneys also can adjust blood volume though mechanisms that
draw water out of the filtrate and urine. The kidneys can regulate water levels in the body; they conserve water if you are
dehydrated, and they can make urine more dilute to expel excess water if necessary. Water is lost through the skin through
evaporation from the skin surface without overt sweating and from air expelled from the lungs. This type of water loss is
called insensible water loss because a person is usually unaware of it.

 Regulation of Water Intake

Osmolality is the ratio of solutes in a solution to a volume of solvent in a solution.
