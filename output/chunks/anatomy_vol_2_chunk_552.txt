It can be performed in a short time—sometimes as quickly as 5 minutes—to establish neurological
function. In the emergency department, this rapid assessment can make the difference with respect to proper treatment and
the extent of recovery that is possible.

 The exam is a series of subtests separated into five major sections. The first of these is the mental status exam,
which assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory, orientation, and language. Then there is the cranial nerve
exam, which tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral structures associated
with them. The cranial nerve exam tests the sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as applicable. Two major
sections, the sensory exam and the motor exam, test the sensory and motor functions associated with spinal nerves. Finally,
the coordination exam tests the ability to perform complex and coordinated movements. The gait exam, which is often
considered a sixth major exam, specifically assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of the
coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.
