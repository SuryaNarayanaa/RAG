KEY TERMS
acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter that binds at a motor end-plate to trigger depolarization

adrenal medulla interior portion of the adrenal (or suprarenal) gland that releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into
the bloodstream as hormones

adrenergic synapse where norepinephrine is released, which binds to a- or B-adrenergic receptors

afferent branch component of a reflex arc that represents the input from a sensory neuron, for either a special or
general sense

agonist any exogenous substance that binds to a receptor and produces a similar effect to the endogenous ligand

alpha (a)-adrenergic receptor one of the receptors to which epinephrine and norepinephrine bind, which comes in
three subtypes: 01, 02, and 03

antagonist any exogenous substance that binds to a receptor and produces an opposing effect to the endogenous ligand

autonomic tone tendency of an organ system to be governed by one division of the autonomic nervous system over the
other, such as heart rate being lowered by parasympathetic input at rest

beta (B)-adrenergic receptor one of the receptors to which epinephrine and norepinephrine bind, which comes in
two subtypes: Bi and B2

are the celiac, inferior mesenteric, and superior mesenteric ganglia

on the anatomical location of central neurons in brain-stem nuclei and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord; also

referred to as craniosacral outflow

dorsal longitudinal fasciculus major output pathway of the hypothalamus that descends through the gray matter of
the brain stem and into the spinal cord

dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve location of parasympathetic neurons that project through the vagus nerve to
terminal ganglia in the thoracic and abdominal cavities

Eddinger-Westphal nucleus location of parasympathetic neurons that project to the ciliary ganglion

efferent branch component of a reflex arc that represents the output, with the target being an effector, such as muscle
or glandular tissue

640 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

endogenous chemical substance produced and released within the body to interact with a receptor protein
endogenous describes substance made in the human body

epinephrine signaling molecule released from the adrenal medulla into the bloodstream as part of the sympathetic
response

exogenous chemical substance from a source outside the body, whether it be another organism such as a plant or
from the synthetic processes of a laboratory, that binds to a transmembrane receptor protein

exogenous describes substance made outside of the human body

fight-or-flight response set of responses induced by sympathetic activity that lead to either fleeing a threat or
standing up to it, which in the modern world is often associated with anxious feelings

G protein-coupled receptor membrane protein complex that consists of a receptor protein that binds to a signaling
molecule—a G protein—that is activated by that binding and in turn activates an effector protein (enzyme) that
creates a second-messenger molecule in the cytoplasm of the target cell

ganglionic neuron specifically refers to the cell body of a neuron in the autonomic system that is located in a ganglion

gray rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans) unmyelinated structures that provide a short connection
from a sympathetic chain ganglion to the spinal nerve that contains the postganglionic sympathetic fiber

greater splanchnic nerve nerve that contains fibers of the central sympathetic neurons that do not synapse in the
chain ganglia but project onto the celiac ganglion

inferior mesenteric ganglion one of the collateral ganglia of the sympathetic system that projects to the digestive
system

intramural ganglia terminal ganglia of the parasympathetic system that are found within the walls of the target
effector

lesser splanchnic nerve nerve that contains fibers of the central sympathetic neurons that do not synapse in the chain
ganglia but project onto the inferior mesenteric ganglion

ligand-gated cation channel ion channel, such as the nicotinic receptor, that is specific to positively charged ions
and opens when a molecule such as a neurotransmitter binds to it

limbic lobe structures arranged around the edges of the cerebrum that are involved in memory and emotion
long reflex reflex arc that includes the central nervous system

medial forebrain bundle fiber pathway that extends anteriorly into the basal forebrain, passes through the
hypothalamus, and extends into the brain stem and spinal cord

mesenteric plexus nervous tissue within the wall of the digestive tract that contains neurons that are the targets of
autonomic preganglionic fibers and that project to the smooth muscle and glandular tissues in the digestive organ

muscarinic receptor type of acetylcholine receptor protein that is characterized by also binding to muscarine and is a
metabotropic receptor

mydriasis dilation of the pupil; typically the result of disease, trauma, or drugs

nicotinic receptor type of acetylcholine receptor protein that is characterized by also binding to nicotine and is an
ionotropic receptor

norepinephrine signaling molecule released as a neurotransmitter by most postganglionic sympathetic fibers as part of
the sympathetic response, or as a hormone into the bloodstream from the adrenal medulla

nucleus ambiguus brain-stem nucleus that contains neurons that project through the vagus nerve to terminal ganglia
in the thoracic cavity; specifically associated with the heart

parasympathetic division division of the autonomic nervous system responsible for restful and digestive functions

parasympathomimetic drugs drugs that enhance or mimic the function of the parasympathetic system

CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM

CHAPTER REVIEW

15.1 Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System

The primary responsibilities of the autonomic nervous system are to regulate homeostatic mechanisms in the body, which
is also part of what the endocrine system does.
