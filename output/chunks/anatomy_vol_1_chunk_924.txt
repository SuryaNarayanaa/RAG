Abduction and Adduction

Abduction and adduction motions occur within the coronal plane and involve medial-lateral motions of the limbs, fingers,
toes, or thumb. Abduction moves the limb laterally away from the midline of the body, while adduction is the opposing
movement that brings the limb toward the body or across the midline. For example, abduction is raising the arm at the
shoulder joint, moving it laterally away from the body, while adduction brings the arm down to the side of the body.
 Similarly, abduction and adduction at the wrist moves the hand away from or toward the midline of the body. Spreading the
fingers or toes apart is also abduction, while bringing the fingers or toes together is adduction. For the thumb, abduction is
the anterior movement that brings the thumb to a 90° perpendicular position, pointing straight out from the palm. Adduction
moves the thumb back to the anatomical position, next to the index finger.
