The clavicular notch is the shallow depression located on either side at the
superior-lateral margins of the manubrium. This is the site of the sternoclavicular joint, between the sternum and clavicle.
 The first ribs also attach to the manubrium.
 The elongated, central portion of the sternum is the body. The manubrium and body join together at the sternal angle,
so called because the junction between these two components is not flat, but forms a slight bend. The second rib attaches to
the sternum at the sternal angle. Since the first rib is hidden behind the clavicle, the second rib is the highest rib that can be
identified by palpation. Thus, the sternal angle and second rib are important landmarks for the identification and counting
of the lower ribs. Ribs 3-7 attach to the sternal body.

 The inferior tip of the sternum is the xiphoid process. This small structure is cartilaginous early in life, but gradually
becomes ossified starting during middle age.
