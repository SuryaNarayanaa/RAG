Vitamin D Synthesis

The epidermal layer of human skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to UV radiation. In the presence of sunlight, a
form of vitamin D3 called cholecalciferol is synthesized from a derivative of the steroid cholesterol in the skin. The liver
converts cholecalciferol to calcidiol, which is then converted to calcitriol (the active chemical form of the vitamin) in the
kidneys. Vitamin D is essential for normal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, which are required for healthy bones.
 The absence of sun exposure can lead to a lack of vitamin D in the body, leading to a condition called rickets, a painful
condition in children where the bones are misshapen due to a lack of calcium, causing bowleggedness. Elderly individuals
who suffer from vitamin D deficiency can develop a condition called osteomalacia, a softening of the bones. In present day
society, vitamin D is added as a supplement to many foods, including milk and orange juice, compensating for the need for
sun exposure.
