Diseases of other organ systems can fall
into this group as well, such as cystic fibrosis or type 2 diabetes. Recognizing the relationship between these diseases
has suggested new therapeutic possibilities. Interfering with the accumulation of the proteins, and possibly as early as
their original production within the cell, may unlock new ways to alleviate these devastating diseases.
