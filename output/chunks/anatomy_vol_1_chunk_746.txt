It is composed of 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages and the sternum.
 The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the manubrium, body, and xiphoid
process. The manubrium and body are joined at the sternal angle, which is also the site for attachment of the second ribs.
 Ribs are flattened, curved bones and are numbered 1-12. Posteriorly, the head of the rib articulates with the costal
acets located on the bodies of thoracic vertebrae and the rib tubercle articulates with the facet located on the vertebral
transverse process. The angle of the ribs forms the most posterior portion of the thoracic cage. The costal groove in the
inferior margin of each rib carries blood vessels and a nerve. Anteriorly, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. True ribs (1-7)
attach directly to the sternum via their costal cartilage. The false ribs (8-12) either attach to the sternum indirectly or not at
all.
