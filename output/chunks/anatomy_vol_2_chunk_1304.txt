Oxygen-rich blood is transported by pulmonary veins to the left atrium.
 The left ventricle pumps this blood into the aorta. The main regions of the aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch,
and descending aorta, which is further divided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The coronary arteries branch from
the ascending aorta. After oxygenating tissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to the right atrium from the
venous system via the superior vena cava, which drains most of the veins superior to the diaphragm, the inferior vena cava,
which drains most of the veins inferior to the diaphragm, and the coronary veins via the coronary sinus. The hepatic portal
system carries blood to the liver for processing before it enters circulation. Review the figures provided in this section for
circulation of blood through the blood vessels.
