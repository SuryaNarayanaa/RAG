Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in sensitive
situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Ultrasonography is used to study
heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as gallbladder disease, and fetal growth and
development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the image quality is heavily operator-dependent and that
it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY

KEY TERMS
abdominopelvic cavity division of the anterior (ventral) cavity that houses the abdominal and pelvic viscera
anabolism assembly of more complex molecules from simpler molecules
anatomical position standard reference position used for describing locations and directions on the human body
anatomy science that studies the form and composition of the body’s structures

anterior cavity larger body cavity located anterior to the posterior (dorsal) body cavity; includes the serous membrane-
lined pleural cavities for the lungs, pericardial cavity for the heart, and peritoneal cavity for the abdominal and
pelvic organs; also referred to as ventral cavity

anterior describes the front or direction toward the front of the body; also referred to as ventral
catabolism breaking down of more complex molecules into simpler molecules

caudal describes a position below or lower than another part of the body proper; near or toward the tail (in humans, the
coccyx, or lowest part of the spinal column); also referred to as inferior

cell smallest independently functioning unit of all organisms; in animals, a cell contains cytoplasm, composed of fluid
and organelles

computed tomography (CT) medical imaging technique in which a computer-enhanced cross-sectional X-ray image
is obtained

control center compares values to their normal range; deviations cause the activation of an effector

cranial cavity division of the posterior (dorsal) cavity that houses the brain

cranial describes a position above or higher than another part of the body proper; also referred to as superior
deep describes a position farther from the surface of the body

development changes an organism goes through during its life

differentiation process by which unspecialized cells become specialized in structure and function

distal describes a position farther from the point of attachment or the trunk of the body

dorsal cavity posterior body cavity that houses the brain and spinal cord; also referred to the posterior body cavity
dorsal describes the back or direction toward the back of the body; also referred to as posterior

effector organ that can cause a change in a value

frontal plane two-dimensional, vertical plane that divides the body or organ into anterior and posterior portions

gross anatomy study of the larger structures of the body, typically with the unaided eye; also referred to macroscopic
anatomy

growth process of increasing in size
homeostasis steady state of body systems that living organisms maintain

inferior describes a position below or lower than another part of the body proper; near or toward the tail (in humans, the
coccyx, or lowest part of the spinal column); also referred to as caudal

lateral describes the side or direction toward the side of the body

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medical imaging technique in which a device generates a magnetic field to
obtain detailed sectional images of the internal structures of the body

medial describes the middle or direction toward the middle of the body

sensor (also, receptor) reports a monitored physiological value to the control center

serosa membrane that covers organs and reduces friction; also referred to as serous membrane
serous membrane membrane that covers organs and reduces friction; also referred to as serosa

set point ideal value for a physiological parameter; the level or small range within which a physiological parameter
such as blood pressure is stable and optimally healthful, that is, within its parameters of homeostasis
