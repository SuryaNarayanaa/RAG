There is no net movement of fluid near the
midpoint since CHP = BCOP. Net reabsorption occurs near the venous end since BCOP is greater than CHP.

 The Role of Lymphatic Capillaries

Since overall CHP is higher than BCOP, it is inevitable that more net fluid will exit the capillary through filtration at the
arterial end than enters through reabsorption at the venous end. Considering all capillaries over the course of a day, this can
be quite a substantial amount of fluid: Approximately 24 liters per day are filtered, whereas 20.4 liters are reabsorbed. This
excess fluid is picked up by capillaries of the lymphatic system. These extremely thin-walled vessels have copious numbers
of valves that ensure unidirectional flow through ever-larger lymphatic vessels that eventually drain into the subclavian
veins in the neck. An important function of the lymphatic system is to return the fluid (lymph) to the blood. Lymph may be
thought of as recycled blood plasma. (Seek additional content for more detail on the lymphatic system.)
