Explain the fate of fluid that is not reabsorbed from the tissues into the vascular capillaries

The primary purpose of the cardiovascular system is to circulate gases, nutrients, wastes, and other substances to and from
the cells of the body. Small molecules, such as gases, lipids, and lipid-soluble molecules, can diffuse directly through the
membranes of the endothelial cells of the capillary wall. Glucose, amino acids, and ions—including sodium, potassium,
calcium, and chloride—use transporters to move through specific channels in the membrane by facilitated diffusion.
 Glucose, ions, and larger molecules may also leave the blood through intercellular clefts. Larger molecules can pass through
the pores of fenestrated capillaries, and even large plasma proteins can pass through the great gaps in the sinusoids. Some
large proteins in blood plasma can move into and out of the endothelial cells packaged within vesicles by endocytosis and
exocytosis.
