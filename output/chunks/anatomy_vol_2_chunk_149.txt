The sensory endings in the skin initiate an electrical signal that travels along the sensory axon within a nerve
into the spinal cord, where it synapses with a neuron in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The temperature information
represented in that electrical signal is passed to the next neuron by a chemical signal that diffuses across the small gap of
the synapse and initiates a new electrical signal in the target cell. That signal travels through the sensory pathway to the
brain, passing through the thalamus, where conscious perception of the water temperature is made possible by the cerebral
cortex. Following integration of that information with other cognitive processes and sensory information, the brain sends a
command back down to the spinal cord to initiate a motor response by controlling a skeletal muscle. The motor pathway is
composed of two cells, the upper motor neuron and the lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron has its cell body in the
cerebral cortex and synapses on a cell in the gray matter of the spinal cord.
