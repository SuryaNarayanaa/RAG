Collateral branches of these fibers synapse on neurons in the pons, which then project into the cerebellar cortex
through the middle cerebellar peduncles. Ascending sensory feedback, entering through the inferior cerebellar peduncles,
provides information about motor performance. The cerebellar cortex compares the command to the actual performance and
can adjust the descending input to compensate for any mismatch. The output from deep cerebellar nuclei projects through
the superior cerebellar peduncles to initiate descending signals from the red nucleus to the spinal cord.

 The primary role of the cerebellum in relation to the spinal cord is through the spinocerebellum; it controls posture and
gait with significant input from the vestibular system. Deficits in cerebellar function result in ataxias, or a specific kind of
movement disorder. The root cause of the ataxia may be the sensory input—either the proprioceptive input from the spinal
cord or the equilibrium input from the vestibular system, or direct damage to the cerebellum by stroke, trauma, hereditary
factors, or toxins.
