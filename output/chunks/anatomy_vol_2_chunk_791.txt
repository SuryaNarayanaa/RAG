Kidneys

The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood flow to
the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and
stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure. The kidneys
also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D3, which is released
in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin
(EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone
marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a
synthetic form).

 Skeleton

Although bone has long been recognized as a target for hormones, only recently have researchers recognized that the
skeleton itself produces at least two hormones.
