Extrinsic tongue muscles insert into the tongue from outside origins, and
the intrinsic tongue muscles insert into the tongue from origins within it. The extrinsic muscles move the whole tongue in
different directions, whereas the intrinsic muscles allow the tongue to change its shape (such as, curling the tongue in a loop
or flattening it).

 The extrinsic muscles all include the word root glossus (glossus = “tongue”), and the muscle names are derived from
where the muscle originates. The genioglossus (genio = “chin”) originates on the mandible and allows the tongue to move
downward and forward. The styloglossus originates on the styloid bone, and allows upward and backward motion. The
palatoglossus originates on the soft palate to elevate the back of the tongue, and the hyoglossus originates on the hyoid
bone to move the tongue downward and flatten it.
