In addition, special exercises will be prescribed, and the child must
also wear special shoes. Close monitoring by the parents and adherence to postoperative instructions are imperative in
minimizing the risk of relapse.

 Despite these difficulties, treatment for clubfoot is usually successful, and the child will grow up to lead a
normal, active life. Numerous examples of individuals born with a clubfoot who went on to successful careers include
Dudley Moore (comedian and actor), Damon Wayans (comedian and actor), Troy Aikman (three-time Super Bowl-
winning quarterback), Kristi Yamaguchi (Olympic gold medalist in figure skating), Mia Hamm (two-time Olympic
gold medalist in soccer), and Charles Woodson (Heisman trophy and Super Bowl winner).
