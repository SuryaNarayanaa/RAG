6.1 | The Functions of the Skeletal System

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
¢ Define bone, cartilage, and the skeletal system
¢ List and describe the functions of the skeletal system

Bone, or osseous tissue, is a hard, dense connective tissue that forms most of the adult skeleton, the support structure
of the body. In the areas of the skeleton where bones move (for example, the ribcage and joints), cartilage, a semi-rigid
form of connective tissue, provides flexibility and smooth surfaces for movement. The skeletal system is the body system
composed of bones and cartilage and performs the following critical functions for the human body:

* supports the body

* facilitates movement

* protects internal organs

¢ produces blood cells

* stores and releases minerals and fat

Support, Movement, and Protection

The most apparent functions of the skeletal system are the gross functions—those visible by observation.
