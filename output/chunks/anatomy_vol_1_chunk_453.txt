The main functions of epithelia are protection from the environment, coverage,
secretion and excretion, absorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by tight junctions that form an impermeable
barrier. They can also be connected by gap junctions, which allow free exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and
anchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to matrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are characterized by
their cellular shapes and arrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar epithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,
whereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very few capillaries penetrate these tissues.

 Glands are secretory tissues and organs that are derived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release their products
through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood stream. Glands are classified
both according to the type of secretion and by their structure. Merocrine glands secrete products as they are synthesized.
 Apocrine glands release secretions by pinching off the apical portion of the cell, whereas holocrine gland cells store their
secretions until they rupture and release their contents.
