In addition to chemical
energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.

 ¢ Mechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly powers
the movement of matter. When you lift a brick into place on a wall, your muscles provide the mechanical energy that
moves the brick.

 * Radiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from long
radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei. The full spectrum of radiant
energy is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. The body uses the ultraviolet energy of sunlight to convert a
compound in skin cells to vitamin D, which is essential to human functioning. The human eye evolved to see the
wavelengths that comprise the colors of the rainbow, from red to violet, so that range in the spectrum is called “visible
light.”
