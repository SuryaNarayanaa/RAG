However, alveoli continue to develop and mature into childhood. A full complement of functional alveoli does
not appear until around 8 years of age.

 Fetal “Breathing”

Although the function of fetal breathing movements is not entirely clear, they can be observed starting at 20-21 weeks
of development. Fetal breathing movements involve muscle contractions that cause the inhalation of amniotic fluid and
exhalation of the same fluid, with pulmonary surfactant and mucus. Fetal breathing movements are not continuous
and may include periods of frequent movements and periods of no movements. Maternal factors can influence the
frequency of breathing movements. For example, high blood glucose levels, called hyperglycemia, can boost the number
of breathing movements. Conversely, low blood glucose levels, called hypoglycemia, can reduce the number of fetal
breathing movements. Tobacco use is also known to lower fetal breathing rates. Fetal breathing may help tone the muscles in
preparation for breathing movements once the fetus is born.
